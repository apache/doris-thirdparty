Apache Hadoop ${project.version}
================================

Apache Hadoop ${project.version} is an update to the Hadoop 3.4.x release branch.

Overview of Changes
===================

Users are encouraged to read the full set of release notes.
This page provides an overview of the major changes.

New binary distribution
-----------------------

As of v3.4.2, Hadoop will only be distributed with a lean tarball, which excludes the full AWS SDK v2 bundle to reduce
overall file size. This release has been tested with AWS SDK v2 2.29.52, which can be downloaded from Maven
[here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk/aws-sdk-java/2.29.52).

S3A improvements
----------------

**Improvement**

[HADOOP-19363](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19363) S3A: Support analytics-accelerator-s3 input streams
for parquet read performance.

[HADOOP-19256](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19256) S3A: Adds support for S3 Conditional Writes.

ABFS improvements
-----------------

**Improvement**

[HADOOP-19179](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19179) ABFS: [FnsOverBlob] Support FNS Accounts over
BlobEndpoint.

[HADOOP-19474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19474)  ABFS: [FnsOverBlob] Listing Optimizations to avoid
multiple iteration over list response.

[HADOOP-19543](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-19543) ABFS: [FnsOverBlob] Remove Duplicates from Blob
Endpoint Listing Across Iterations.

Transitive CVE fixes
--------------------

A lot of dependencies have been upgraded to address recent CVEs.
Many of the CVEs were not actually exploitable through the Hadoop
so much of this work is just due diligence.
However, applications which have all the library is on a class path may
be vulnerable, and the upgrades should also reduce the number of false
positives security scanners report.

We have not been able to upgrade every single dependency to the latest
version there is. Some of those changes are fundamentally incompatible.
If you have concerns about the state of a specific library, consult the Apache JIRA
issue tracker to see if an issue has been filed, discussions have taken place about
the library in question, and whether or not there is already a fix in the pipeline.
*Please don't file new JIRAs about dependency-X.Y.Z having a CVE without
searching for any existing issue first*

As an open-source project, contributions in this area are always welcome,
especially in testing the active branches, testing applications downstream of
those branches and of whether updated dependencies trigger regressions.


Security Advisory
=================

Hadoop HDFS is a distributed filesystem allowing remote
callers to read and write data.

Hadoop YARN is a distributed job submission/execution
engine allowing remote callers to submit arbitrary
work into the cluster.

Unless a Hadoop cluster is deployed with
[caller authentication with Kerberos](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html),
anyone with network access to the servers has unrestricted access to the data
and the ability to run whatever code they want in the system.

In production, there are generally three deployment patterns which
can, with care, keep data and computing resources private.
1. Physical cluster: *configure Hadoop security*, usually bonded to the
   enterprise Kerberos/Active Directory systems.
   Good.
2. Cloud: transient or persistent single or multiple user/tenant cluster
   with private VLAN *and security*.
   Good.
   Consider [Apache Knox](https://knox.apache.org/) for managing remote
   access to the cluster.
3. Cloud: transient single user/tenant cluster with private VLAN
   *and no security at all*.
   Requires careful network configuration as this is the sole
   means of securing the cluster..
   Consider [Apache Knox](https://knox.apache.org/) for managing
   remote access to the cluster.

*If you deploy a Hadoop cluster in-cloud without security, and without configuring a VLAN
to restrict access to trusted users, you are implicitly sharing your data and
computing resources with anyone with network access*

If you do deploy an insecure cluster this way then port scanners will inevitably
find it and submit crypto-mining jobs. If this happens to you, please do not report
this as a CVE or security issue: it is _utterly predictable_. Secure *your cluster* if
you want to remain exclusively *your cluster*.

Finally, if you are using Hadoop as a service deployed/managed by someone else,
do determine what security their products offer and make sure it meets your requirements.

Protobuf Compatibility
===============

In HADOOP-18197, we upgraded the Protobuf in hadoop-thirdparty to version 3.21.12.
This version may have compatibility issues with certain versions of JDK8,
and you may encounter some errors (please refer to the discussion in HADOOP-18197 for specific details).

To address this issue, we recommend upgrading the JDK version in your production environment to a higher version (> JDK8).
We will resolve this issue by upgrading hadoop-thirdparty's Protobuf to a higher version in a future release of 3.4.x.
Please note that we will discontinue support for JDK8 in future releases of 3.4.x.

Getting Started
===============

The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using
Hadoop. Begin with the
[Single Node Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
which shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation.
Then move on to the
[Cluster Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html)
to learn how to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.

Before deploying Hadoop in production, read
[Hadoop in Secure Mode](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html),
and follow its instructions to secure your cluster.
