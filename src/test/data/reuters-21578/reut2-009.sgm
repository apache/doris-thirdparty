<TITLE>BALDRIGE SUPPORTS NIC TALKS ON CURRENCIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized
countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the
dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade
deficit.
    "We do need to do something with those currencies or we
will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,"
or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar,
Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee.
    The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and
European currencies, but has changed very little against the
currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and
Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar.
    As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over
the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade
deficits with those countries.
    Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the
Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries
to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates.

<TITLE>FEUD PERSISTS AT U.S. HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTTEE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A feud among Democrats and
Republicans persisted at the House Budget Committee, stalling
the writing of a fiscal 1988 U.S. budget plan.
    Republicans failed to appear at a drafting session called
by Democratic committee chairman William Gray as a make-up
meeting to end bickering that has delayed budget activity  for
a week and threatens the ability of Congress meeting an April
15 deadline for completing the deficit-cutting budget.
    Republicans told Gray yesterday they would appear today and
participate if the meeting was held behind closed doors.

    He said the Republicans were prepared to make a "good faith"
effort to cooperate if the budget deliberations were held
behind closed doors and not in public as is the normal
procedure.
    However, they failed to appear today and Gray said he had
been told they wanted House Speaker Jim Wright to answer a
series of budget questions posed by House Republican leader Bob
Michel before they would cooperate in budget matters.
     The budget feuding led the Washington Post today to
editorialize that it was childish, similar to an eraser fight
among fourth grade students.

<TITLE>FARM CREDIT SYSTEM SEEN NEEDING 800 MLN DLRS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>A member of the board which
regulates the farm credit system said Congress should plan to
provide at least 800 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988 to bailout the
troubled system, but other members of the board differed.
    Jim Billington, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board
member told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee
hearing "I feel your subcommittee should plan on providing at
least 800 mln next year to assist the Farm Credit System."
    However, FCA board member Marvin Duncan differed, saying
"it is premature to talk about the cost of a solution until we
know what kind of solution."
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, said it might be
possible to structure a rescue of the system with government
guarantees or a line of credit which requires little or no
upfront government money.
    However, Billington said Congress must provide help
immediately because "this system needs some assurance that it
will get some help."
    The FCA estimates the system could lose up to 1.4 billion
dlrs in 1987, exhausting the remainder of its working capital,
Naylor said.
    The farm credit system is expected to present its own
proposals for government aid to a Senate Agriculture
subcommittee hearing on Thursday.
    Naylor said the Treasury Department is continuing to refine
Reagan administration ideas on how a rescue should be
structured.
    Congressional sources said they hope to begin drafting a
rescue bill for the farm credit system as early as next week.

<TITLE>UNIONIST URGES RETALIATION AGAINST JAPAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>William Bywater, president of the
International Union of Electronic Workers, called on President
Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in
semiconductor trade.
    He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the
semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from
becoming "one of the world's industrial lightweights."
    Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy
Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what
sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged 
violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement.
    The pact, agreed to last July, called for Tokyo to end
selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home
market to U.S. goods. In return, Washington agreed to forego
antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.
    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped
dumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country
dumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.
    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,
ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to
force prices up and end the dumping.
    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science
Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new
electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the
U.S. industory more competitive.
    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to
pass and that action was required now to help the depressed
electronic industry.
    Bywater said, "I urge the Reagan Administration to take full
and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the
retaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)."

<TITLE>DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Claire Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's
losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency
is headed for a further retreat.
    Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive
that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.
    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over
the currency market than central bank intervention and these
argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.
    "The market can be bigger than the central banks. And
economic fundamentals will always come to the fore," said a
dealer at one major U.S. bank.
    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the
yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,
Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.
    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar
recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from
the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still
failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.
    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5
billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.
    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the
Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen
today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
a small amount of dollars for yen.
    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28
when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.
    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February
22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.
    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften
extreme moves in the market.
    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's
purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  
watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.
    The Bank of England's action also was thought to be
completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing
the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
nations in its support of the currency pact.
    "No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other
two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
anything else," said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.
    "I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted," said
Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. 
"It's a yen problem more than anything else."
    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American
authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.
    "The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the
Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on
its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,"
said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.
    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official
denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a
lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.
    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
deficit in 1986 was with Japan.
    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on
Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.
    "The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The
currency market is becoming very political," said Natsuo Okada
of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
of April or early May.
    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic
imbalances in the near future, dealers said.
    "Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it
won't be enough to help the trade situation much," said
Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to
148 yen in the next couple of days.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Guinness PLC> has joined investors
suing former Wall Street speculator Ivan Boesky, alleging it
was deceived into putting money into his one billion dlr
investment partnership in 1986.
    Guinness, the largest limited partner in Ivan F. Boeksy and
Co. L.P., is the latest to file suit in federal court in
Manhattan against Boesky, court papers show.
    About 40 other investors have also filed suit over similar
allegations, including that Boesky did not reveal his illegal
insider trading activities.
    Guinness is charging it was induced to join in the Boesky
partnership through a prospectus that contained "material untrue
statements and omissions."
    The suit also alleged that the Boesky Corporation, which
became a part in the formation of the investment partnership,
Ivan F. Boesky and Co., L.P., "had achieved its extraordinary
rates of return as a result of trading on inside information
and other violations of the securities laws."
    In addition, the suit charged that Boesky and other
defendants unlawfully "schemed with and provided substantial
assistance to one another to evade the registration provisions"
of securities law.

<TITLE>CHARTER CO &lt;QCHR> TO COMPLETE REORGANIZATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Charter Co, the huge
petrochemical concern in bankruptcy proceedings stemming from
hundreds of dioxin-related claims, said it and all of its
subsidiaries, except the Independent Petrochemical Corp, will
complete their reorganization on March 31.
    It said that on that date, it will deposit with an escrow
agent 288.8 mln dlrs in cash, 66.7 mln dlrs in notes and 31 mln
shares of its common for distribution.
    Company officials were not immediately available for
comment.
    As previously reported, Charter settled dioxin-related
claims for about 1,200 individuals and the state of Missouri,
resolving claims against it and all subsidiaries except
Independent Petrochemical.
    Charter said some of the settlements remain subject to
appeals and final court approvals and resolve claims against
charter and its subsidiaries except Independent Petrochemical.
    It said about 500 individual claims against it and certain
of its units remain pending as disputed claims in bankruptcy
court. It said about 300 of these claims have been filed since
confirmation of the joint plan of reorganization.
    Charter said its two creditors, an equity committee in its
bankruptcy proceedings and &lt;American Financial Corp>, which
will own 50.5 pct of its common after the reorganization, have
waived the requirement that Charter resolve all dioxin-related
claims against it prior to completing its reorganization.
    That requirement excludes claims against Independent
Petrochemical. Charter also said a plan for liquidation of
Independent has been approved by the bankruptcy court and will
be completed after March 31.
    Earlier, Charter reported net income for the year of 153.2
mln dlrs, which included a gain of 28.5 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations and 114.8 mln dlrs for the settlement
of claims in its reorganization proceedings.
    In 1985, it reported earnings of 1,274,000 dlrs, which
included a loss of 36.3 mln dlrs for discontinued operations
and 29.4 mln dlrs for extraordinary items.
    For the fourth quarter, it reported earnings of 118.8 mln
dlrs, including a gain of 28.6 mln dlrs for discontinued
operations and 90.5 mln dlrs mainly for claims settlements. In
the year-ago period, Charter reported a loss of 13 mln dlrs.

offer made last week by a partnership of AFG Industries Inc
&lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown.
    In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its
outstanding common shares, GenCorp had suggested the adoption
of a classified or "staggered" board and the elimination of
cumulative voting.
    GenCorp said these proposals could "distract energy and
attention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the
tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the
company, its shareholders and its other constituencies."
    GenCorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding
shares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a
dividend increase.
    The other proposals, it said, would provide for greater
long-term stability and cohesiveness for the GenCorp board.
    The company did not indicate when it might resubmit the
proposals for approval by its shareholders.

<TITLE>U.S. CAR SALES DOWN 3.9 PCT IN MID-MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Detroit, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sales of U.S.-made cars during
mid-March, the traditional start of the spring selling season,
dropped 3.9 pct behind last year's level, analysts say.
    Automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the March 11-20
selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. Analysts said the
decline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.
    Buyers shied away from the showrooms of American Motors
Corp &lt;AMO>, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid from
Chrysler Corp &lt;C>. Analysts said consumers were anxious about
the whether Chrysler will retain some American Motors models,
causing a 62 pct drop in American Motors sales in mid-March.
    Chrysler's mid-March sales fell 3.6 pct.
    "During the spring selling season, you usually look for
some kind of seasonal uplift in sales. It doesn't look like
it's happening," said Joseph Philippi, analyst with E.F. Hutton
and Co.
    "There may be less bloom to the spring selling season this
year than last," one auto company official conceded.
    General Motors Corp &lt;GM>, still working to regain consumer
interest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.
    Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> sales increased 15.2 pct for the
period. But analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 period
for Ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.
    "The total industry (mid-March sales) was slightly less
than expected," the company official said.
    American Motors' decline caught analysts eye. "American
Motors took it on the chin--big," said Philippi.
    Given the prospective takeover by Chrysler, "people might
be a little leary about going to (American Motors) dealers," he
said.
    American Motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period,
meaning each of American Motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a car
about every other day," Philippi said.
    Potential American Motors buyers are afraid their car
models "might disappear," he said.
    Chrysler, in its purchase agreement with American Motors'
majority stockholder &lt;Renault>, has agreed not to undercut
sales of American Motors' new Medallion and Premier cars, made
by Renault.
    On a company by company basis, sales of U.S. made cars from
the March 11 to 20 period were--GM 105,438, down 14.8 pct, Ford
67,672, up 15.2 pct, Chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, American
Motors 790, down 6.2 pct, American Honda 7,447 compared with
5,031, Nissan Motor Corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, Volkswagon U.S.
Inc 1,330, down 35 pct.

<TITLE>RESORTS INT'L &lt;RT.A> RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Resorts International Inc
said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which
holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
formed through the takeover.
    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
common stock in the new company.
    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
corporation.
    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
mln dlrs of equity.
    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
special preferred stock.
    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
preferred stock.
    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
to advise its board on the offer.
    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
752,297 class B shares outstanding.
    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
class B shares outstanding.
    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
power of the class B shares.
    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
Resorts.
    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
operations.
    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman.
    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
not immediately available for comment.
    Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
spokesman for the Crosby estate.

<TITLE>CITICORP &lt;CCI> SEES DOUBLING IN RETAIL BANK NET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Citicorp expects net income in its
individual banking sector to top one billion dlrs by 1993,
compared with 462 mln dlrs in 1986, said Richard Braddock, head
of Citicorp's individual banking division.
    "We can double our earnings over the next five to seven
years," he told a banking analysts meeting, adding that this
forecast may be on the conservative side.
    He said that bank card operations and the New York branch
system would continue to turn in hefty profits but also picked
out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and
international consumer, as major potential earners.
    Braddock and his sector heads made the following more
specific predictions:
    - Cost of funds and net credit loss levels in the U.S.
bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's
relatively inflated levels.
    - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will
rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
    - The international consumer business will show 22 pct
compound annual growth in earnings between 1986 and 1992.
    - Private banking earnings will hit 100 mln dlrs in 1987
and top 200 mln dlrs in 1992.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The National Association of Securities
Dealers, which will launch a search for a new president later
this week, will probably concentrate on candidates with an
extensive background in the financial markets, officials of the
organization said today.
    Gordon Macklin, 58, who has served as president for 17
years, today announced his decision to leave the organization
of 6,658 broker-dealers. Macklin will join Hambrecht and Quist
as chairman and co-chief executive officer.
    Association chairman Joseph Hardiman will appoint a search
committee later this week.
    The committee will have its first meeting as early as next
week. The new president is expected to be someone knowledgable
about the over-the-counter markets and committed to the concept
of self-regulation.
    Macklin joined the association as president in 1970,
leaving a position at McDonald and Co.
    The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations System, which currently lists 5200 securities of
4400 companies, was ushered in 10 months after Macklin's
arrival.

Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer
market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant
industry time to develop.
    "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.
The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to
some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial
development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archer
said at the opening of a national software conference.
    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no
major progress in their computer row, which they have been
trying to resolve for the past 18 months.
    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting
its computer industry from imports.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House
Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals
scheduled for consideration Wednesday.
    Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a
proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries
that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government
debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms
abroad.
    He added, "even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to
be particularly directed," has started opening its markets.
    In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also
said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries
by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to
commercial banks, was a problem.
    "I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine
the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to
achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the
policies that are followed on servicing external debt," Volcker
said.
    It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to
extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said.
    Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary
James Baker "about the inappropriateness of using public
resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we
both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international
debt facility."
    He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures
for international negotiations on currency exchange rates "is
unrealistic and could well have damaging effects."
    "For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations
in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar
-- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference
among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially
destabilizing market expectations," Volcker said.
    He recommended "we should not lock ourselves into formalized
procedures for international negotiations" on exchange rates but
instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting
in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives
and those of major trade allies.

<TITLE>U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    by Maggie McNeil, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. corn acreage this year is 
likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
years, Agriculture Department officials said.
    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
around seven billion bushels.
    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
analysts said.
    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not
go along with the program this year."
    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
billion bushels.
    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
reduction in production," an analyst said.
    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
increase significantly, a specialist said.
    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
participation in government programs, analysts said.
    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"
he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
higher-producing delta areas.
    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
steadily declined in the 1980's.
    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.
    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
said.
    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
pct of their acreage.
    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
provide more incentives," an analyst said.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Leading U.S. farm state senators are
seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a
provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the
U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,
to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including
the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.
    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to
recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading
practices.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to
broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be
eligible for the subsidies, sources said.
    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor
(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --
also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork
producers and processors from Canadian imports.
    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),
would clarify the definition of "industry" in determining whether
or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.
    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the
International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live
swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming
U.S. producers.
    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply
replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.

<TITLE>FED'S JOHNSON SAYS FED ACTED TO STABILIZE DOLLAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said the dollar has stabilized against other
currencies after action taken by the Fed.
    "We have taken the appropriate action and the dollar has
stabilized," Johnson said after testifying to a House Banking
subcommittee.
    He did not elaborate on the nature of the action nor when
it was taken, but said that it was in the spirit of the
agreement reached by six industrial nations in Paris recently.
    Johnson said the dollar's decline against other currencies
such as the Japanese yen has been gradual.
    Since the accord by the United States, Britain, West
Germany, Japan, France and Canada, foreign exchange markets
have been closely watching for indications of intervention by
central banks to determine the committment by those nations to
their agreement.
    The nations agreed that currency exchange rates were at
about the correct levels when the pact was signed earlier this
year.
