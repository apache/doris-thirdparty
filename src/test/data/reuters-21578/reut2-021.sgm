<TITLE>HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
of the structure remained.
    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
been caught laying mines.
    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
U.S. "tit-for-tat" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
    He said with this appraoch America would suffer "the death
of one thousand cuts."
    But for the United States to grab the initiative
militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
shipping must pass, Schuler said.
    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
    He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
settlement.
    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
    Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it
accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of
General Motors Corp &lt;GM> in contract negotiations.
    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the
11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead
of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.
    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White told
reporters.
    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike," he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.
    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike
would be avoided.
    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved
we're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.
    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," he
said.
    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the
weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.
    White said the union has also received assurances that a
job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does
not threaten Canadian jobs.
    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches
agreements at Ford &lt;F> and Chrysler &lt;C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct
immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.

<TITLE>DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Ian MacKenzie</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
    U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
    "We consider the matter closed," he said, a signal the U.S.
administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
would endanger American interests.
    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
"crushing blow."
    "The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
no way get out safely," Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
said.
    "The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
respond one way or the other," a diplomat said.
    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
    Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
the United States could have taken once it had decided to
retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
and Kuwaitis on Iran.
    "It's interesting that they chose something in international
waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation," one
diplomat said. "This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
Arab states, particularly Kuwait."
    Commented another diplomat: "Kuwait must be happy that the
U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
on its doorstep."
    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: "They
managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
least nuisance to everybody."
    A diplomat commented: "They were very clever in the place
they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
anything because it wasn't working in the first place."
    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
"This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."

<TITLE>LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Military experts say the United States
faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
U.S.-flagged tanker.
    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
limited retaliatory strikes.
    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
    "Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
cycle of attack and retaliation continues," said Fred Axelgard,
a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).
    "It's like a Greek tragedy," said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
think tank.
    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
the war between Iran and Iraq.
    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
President Reagan could never accept.
    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
Isle City on Friday.
    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
allowed to escape.
    "We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
with stronger countermeasures," Weinberger said.
    "We consider this matter closed," he said.
    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
this view after earlier clashes.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, Oct 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The British Treasury confirmed that the
sale of British Petroleum Co Plc will go ahead as planned,
despite Monday's stock market crash which forced BP below the

    "The government are not considering terminating the BP
offer. The offer has been fully underwritten," a Treasury
spokesman said.
    The issue, which remains open until October 28, was fully
underwritten last week when the issue price was set.
    BP shares closed down 33p at 317p as the FT-SE 100 share
index crashed a record 249.6 points, more than 10 pct.

    Angelo Mozilo, vice chairman and executive vice president,
also told security analysts that that company should have a
total loan servicing portfolio of 11 billion or 12 billion dlrs
by the end of the current fiscal year, in February 1988.
    Countrywide Credit, a financial service company primarily
involved in mortgage banking, reported 4.5 billion dlrs in its
loan servicing portfolio for the last fiscal year.
    In addition, Mozilo said the company was continuing to
reduce expenses by one mln dlrs a month and should bring total
costs down by three mln dlrs at the end of the quarter.
    He said about 55 pct of the cost cuts were in personnel,
and that the company had reduced the number of its offices
nationwide by 11 in recent months.

VENEZUELA SAYS OPEC OIL OUTPUT 0VER 18 MLN BPD CARACAS, Oct 19
- The current OPEC oil production is above 18 mln barrels per
day (bpd) and this level threatens the precarious equilibrium
of the of oil market, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters three or four countries out of OPEC's 13
members were mainly responsible for the overproduction, but
declined to identify them.
     OPEC's production ceiling for the second half of 1987 is
16.6 mln bpd. The Venezuelan minister said OPEC's production
reached a peak this year when it went over 19 mln bpd in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti, together with the oil ministers of
Nigeria and Indonesia, met the heads of state of six Mideast
Gulf countries earlier this month to urge OPEC members to
comply with assigned production quotas.
    He said some of the countries which were complying as
Venezuela, Indonesia, Libya, Algeria, Ecuador, Saudi Arabia and
Iran.
    Hernandez declined to say whether the three or four
countries he said were overproducing bordered the Mideast Gulf.
