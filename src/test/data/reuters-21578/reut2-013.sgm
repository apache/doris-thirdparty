<TITLE>WALL STREET STOCKS/COMPAQ COMPUTER &lt;CPQ></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Compaq Computer Corp, IBM's chief
rival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain on
Wall Street today. Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 on
volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that the
damage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less than
expected." He said Compaq's stock had been under pressure
recently because of anticipation of IBM's unveiling of a new
line of personal computers.
    International Business Machines &lt;IBM> introduced four new
personal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products.
But analysts said the new computers, though they do contain a
lot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy as
some other PC makers had feared.
    "The long range issue here is who wins and who loses in the
PC business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and is
unlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst Mark Stahlman of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co said.
    Stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of Compaq and Apple
Computer Inc &lt;AAPL>.
    Stahlman said "The critical investment question now is who
will have a pickup in sales in the near term. We expect to see
a strong demand setting for PCs for the rest of this year, and
that will boost the revenues for all of the major PC vendors."
    "The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period on
record for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don't
think the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon."
    "In anticipating the IBM announcement, Compaq has made
pricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediate
purposes," he said.

<TITLE>NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Murdochville, Quebec, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Noranda Inc> said
production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper
mine here until it can completely examine the mine.
    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned itself out
late yesterday, killed one miner and trapped 56 others
underground for about 24 hours. The 56 were eventually brought
safely out of the mine.
    Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could
take from a few days to several weeks, but would not be more
specific.
    Noranda said that, when it resumes production, it plans to
operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 metric
tons annual finished capacity.
    The fire weakened part of the mine's support structure,
Coffin said.
    Noranda said if it decides to keep the mine open, it would
take four or five months before it could resume full
production.

<TITLE>FHLBB SAYS MORTGAGE RATES CONTINUE DECLINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said
home mortgage rates fell from early February to early March to
their lowest point in nine years, but the rate of decline was
slower than it had been in recent months.
    The bank board said the average effective commitment rate
for fixed-rate mortgages for single family homes and a 25 pct
loan-to-price ratio with a maturity of at least 15 years was
9.48 pct in early March.
    The rate was four basis points lower than a month ago, only
one-eighth the size of decline in the previous month, the bank
board said.
    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages decline eight basis
points from early February to 8.43 pct in early March, the bank
board said. The drop was far less than the 15 basis point
decline in the previous period, the agency said.
    The average effective interest rate on all loans closed by
major mortgage lenders declined nine basis points from early
February to early March, the agency said. The fall brought the
rate to 9.14 pct was the lowest since December 1977, it said.
    The effective rate for ARMS was 8.39 pct, 15 basis points
below a month earlier. For fixed-rate loans it was 9.36 pct, 14
basis points below a month earlier, the agency said.

<TITLE>LARGER VOLUME SEEN ON EUROPEAN OPTIONS EXCHANGES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    AMSTERDAM, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>European options exchanges will see
spectacular growth over the next five years as more
professional investors discover the options markets, Bernard
Reed, manager of the London options exchange said.
    At an options outlook seminar to mark tomorrow's official
opening of a new Amsterdam options exchange (EOE) building, he
forecast increasing interest from banks and institutional
investors, using options for portfolio insurance.
    "But the dominance by the professionals should not make us
neglect private clients," he noted. "Successful exploitation of
retail business has been one of the keys to success."
    Reed said derived option products in particular will become
a popular instrument for managing equity risks. On the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the cash-settled S&amp;P 100 index
option is the most traded in the world.
    Dutch Stock Index Fund options to be relaunched on May 18
and the upcoming options on London's FTSE 100 index will see a
30 pct yearly turnover growth until 1990, Reed estimated.
    The CBOE and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have agreed
with Morgan Stanley to trade options and futures on the capital
international EAFE index which will let investors participate
in worldwide market moves.
    Reed said he did not believe in globalising the option
business by introducing international products, because this
would intensify competition among the exchanges, but he did see
a future for global rules and regulations.

<TITLE>UNION TO PROTEST DART'S SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LANDOVER, MD., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Food And Commercial
Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the
union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp's headquarters
protesting Dart's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of
Supermarkets General &lt;SGL>.
    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and
also owns Rickels home centers.
    The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid
because "workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the
current takeover mania."
    A Union statement said: "We do not intend to allow our
members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General's executives
and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions."
    Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington, which
last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.
The Hafts lost, but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in
profits, analysts estimate.
    The union said that Dart's Safeway bid forced a major
restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and
caused a loss of thousands of jobs.

<DATELINE>    TEMPE, Ariz., April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>FCS Laboratories Inc said merger
discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the
health care field have ended without an agreement.
    The previously announced negotiations began last August,
the company said.
    "It's disappointing to spend so much time on these
negotiations and have them fail," said FCS chairman Nicholas
Gallo III. "But the discussions could not produce a deal
acceptable to our board in the context of the company's
stronger financial position today as compared to six months
ago."
    Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger
partners, but will respond to serious inquiries.
    "We are determined to follow our plan to restore this
company to profitability," he said. "To continue actively
searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to
postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are
part of the plan."
    The company, which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding,
reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of
the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987.

<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Burlington Northern Inc said its
Burlington Northern Railroad Co unit reached an agreement in
principle to settle a class action lawsuit filed against the
company in May 1985 by holders of two series of the company's
bonds.
    It said the settlement arrangement calls for the company to
establish a cash settlement fund of 35.5 mln dlrs, which would
be distributed to the bondholders after deductions for
attorney's fees.
    The lawsuit, filed by holders of its four pct Prior Lien
bonds due January 1, 1997 and its three pct General Lien Bonds
due January 1, 2047, sought to prevent the release of
collateral, the company said.
    If the settlement agreement is approved, the trading prices
of the bonds will decline substantially because they will no
longer reflect the speculative premiums at which the bonds
currently trade, Burlington Northern also said.
    It said the settlement is subject to negotiation by
Burlington Northern, the Citibank N.A. unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>
and Bankers Trust Co &lt;BT>, the bonds' trustees.

<TITLE>UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. Government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.
    Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role
in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless
Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for
Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside
competition.
    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of
attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said "I am not sure
it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of
Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a
personal interest in this problem.
    "I don't understand it to be closed at all."
    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be
"talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what
they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very
serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not
as free as we allow access to our markets to be."
    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain
could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance
institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar
treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.
    "I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,"
Howard added.
    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,
and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.
    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any
significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese
telecommunications industry.
    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined
again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.
This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul
Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.
    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain
believed a "sensible solution" could be found which would open
Japanese markets to British goods.
    Government officials were at pains today to deny that
Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise
similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial
firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.
    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials
had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial
institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not
necessarily constitute a deadline.
    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against
Japanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But
despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade
elsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to
backfire.
    He said in a radio interview today  "it is true that we
benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose
those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views
plain to the Japanese government on this matter."
    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before
returning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was
planned well before the current trade row.
    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also
include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global
markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a
cooperation between national regulatory bodies.
    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging
information to combat financial fraud would be sought with
Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between
Britain and the United States.

<TITLE>U.S., JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. and Japanese officials meet
tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade
and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President
Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports.
    But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord
could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from
about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17.
    The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the
Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized. The penalties
would be retroactive to March 31.
    Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he
hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in
semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted.
    Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow, with
meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and
Friday. Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13.
    The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include
Shigeru Muraoka, director-general of international trade policy
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), and
Masashi Yamamoto, deputy director-general of the information
and machinery bureau.
    Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima, director of the
Japan office of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, and Jim
Gradoville, of trade representative's office of industry and
services.
    The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be
headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and
MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda.

<TITLE>BRITAIN'S ECGD DISCUSSING NEW COVER FOR NIGERIA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD) is holding talks with Nigeria aimed at
resuming insurance cover for British exporters to Nigeria, the
head of ECGD's international debt division, Gerry Breach, said.
    The ECGD suspended cover on Nigeria in 1984 after the
country fell into arrears on payments of insured and uninsured
debts.
    Following last week's bilateral accord between Britain and
Nigeria to reschedule the country's insured trade debts,
bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of
cover.
    Breach made his comments in an address to a private meeting
of businessmen, a copy of which was made available to the
press.
    Breach noted that for the ECGD to consider "a gradual
introduction of a package of new support" certain criteria would
have to be met.
    This would involve the Nigerian economic structural
adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by
the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on
course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a
satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of
the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.
    Breach said that these criteria are now beginning to be
satisfied, adding that while the ECGD could not yet formally
announce new cover, it was holding discussions with Nigeria on
priorities for new credits.
    He said an announcement would be made "as soon as possible"
on an agreement and the ECGD would create a package for Nigeria
that would include the department's normal range of export
trade support facilities.
    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.
    Breach noted that since cover was removed, the ECGD has
maintained a limited amount of short-term trade cover for
Nigeria, which was backed by letters of credit from the
Nigerian Central Bank.
    While the ECGD would initially continue to use this
structure under a new package, it would also hope to expand the
volume of coverage in the short-term area and relax the terms
it is prepared to underwrite towards the commonly accepted
maximum of 180 days.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.K. government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.

<TITLE>CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a
new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread
throughout the industrial world.
    But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action
by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic
goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a
full-scale trade war.
    Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing
countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading
environment increased the possibility of global economic
growth.
    "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many
countries in the developing world which have encouraged the
opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the
developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said.
    He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant
retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in
trade policy."
    The interview came just before next week's semi-annual
meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
    Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium,
Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious
and must be closely watched.
    He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on
making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the
developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will
increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.
    The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the
debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new
funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms
aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment
and reducing government's role in the economy.
    "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect,
however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,"
Conable said.
    He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would
continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending
for some time.
    He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many
countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the
problem of debt."
    Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York
chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He
is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched
the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,
1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by
the World Bank.
    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major
study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next
several weeks.
    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in
part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the
poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the
richest countries because of inefficiency.
    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by
Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151
member-countries as an indication of his management style and
priorities.
    "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who
must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be
permitted to grow," Conable said.
    However, he said "I don't believe there is anything
basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it
has to have any redefinition of its purpose."
    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt
initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role
in dealing with the debt crisis.
    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its
sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and
that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus on a variety of issues.
    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need
to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have
a particular mission here except to be useful to the
institution and to the process of development."
    He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize
the institution."
    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said
that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting
the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing
of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development
Association was earmarked for Africa.
    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new
forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those
in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.

<TITLE>BOEING SEEKS CAUSE OF JAL ENGINE PROBLEM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEATTLE, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Boeing Co. &lt;BA> is trying to find out
what caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's
747-SR jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer
said.
    "We know about the problem and we have provided a service
advisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "We are not
advising any massive inspections at this time."
    The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a
problem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it does
not recommend any action.
    "A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is
anything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said.
    A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routine
check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to
the wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue.
    The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of
its 747-SR's. The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been
modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan, mainly
between Tokyo and Osaka.
    The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a
higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs.
    Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlines
use the 747-SR. JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973
and purchased two more last year. He said the braces had been
shipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were being
inspected.

bankers had hoped that talks would commence on a resumption of
cover.
    Breach told a businessmen's meeting that for the ECGD to
consider "a gradual introduction of a package of new support"
certain criteria would have to be met.
    This would involve the Nigerian economic structural
adjustment program being put into effect and being endorsed by
the International Monetary Fund, the program remaining on
course and continuing to be endorsed by the IMF and a
satisfactory level of acceptance by the Nigerian government of
the ECGD insured short-term trade arrears.
    British exports to Nigeria exceeded 550 mln stg in 1986.

<TITLE>BP CREDIT FACILITY SUBSTANTIALLY OVERSUBSCRIBED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A five billion dlr credit facility being
arranged for two units of British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>
attracted over 15 billion dlrs in syndication but will not be
increased, Morgan Guaranty Ltd said on behalf of Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co of New York, the arranger.
    It said that 64 of BP's relationship banks will be joining
the facility, although their participations will be cut back
dramatically. Banks had been invited as lead managers at 200
mln dlrs, managers at 125 mln and co-managers at 75 mln.
    BP will make the final decision on the allotments broadly
based on relationships rather than on the amounts offered.
    The facility is being arranged for BP International and BP
North America in conjunction with the company's planned tender
offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already
own.
    Because of the purpose of the facility, Morgan only had
five business days to arrange the facility. As a result, it
carried terms that bankers considered relatively favourable
when compared with those on most other recent credits. The
facility fee, for example, was 1/8 pct compared with the 1/16
pct BP paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing.

<TITLE>U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>A steep drop in goods-producing jobs
detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes
it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
policy to defend the dollar, economists said.
    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less
than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets
expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with
February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment
dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.
    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
the second and third quarters."
    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"
he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but
clearly they can't tighten."
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000
from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
were weaker than expected.
    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.
gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March
jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter
growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.
    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only
237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, 
but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs
were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
tightening for exchange-related purposes."
    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January
level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing
hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9
hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.
    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and 
electronic manufacturing.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.
    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories
resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.
    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
the first-quarter GNP accounts.
    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two
pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the
second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial
activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."
    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
in industrial production and personal income for March.
They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for
these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct
in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.
    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851
million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in
January.
    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level
since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed
out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which 
fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.
    "This just means that there were fewer people looking for
work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.
    He said the latest employment report will not concern the
Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten
to quickly either."
    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with
his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.
    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think
that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to
ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March
employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,
regardless of the dollar."

<TITLE>UK SEEKS PACT WITH JAPAN FOR INFORMATION EXCHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard
said he will use a coming trip to Tokyo to seek a memorandum of
understanding between Britain and Japan on the exchange of
information to fight fraud in world financial markets.
    He told journalists that he would be seeking an agreement
with Japan similar to one struck last autumn between the U.K.
Department of Trade and Industry, on the one hand, and the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission on the other.
    Market sources have persistently speculated that it was
information passed on to the U.K. By the SEC through their pact
that triggered the DTI's investigations into (Guinness Plc's)
&lt;GUIN.L> takeover of &lt;Distillers Co Plc> last year.
    The probe, launched in December, triggered the resignation
of some of Guinness' senior management, including Chairman
Ernest Saunders.
    The Trade department, however, has never confirmed this and
has yet to state what its investigation actually concerns.
