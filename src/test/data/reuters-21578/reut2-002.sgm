<TITLE>JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its
new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
John Egan told a news conference.
    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director John Edwards said.
    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
but Egan said this would take at least another three years
    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
expectations, dealers said.

<TITLE>FRENCH CGE GROUP LIKELY TO BE PRIVATISED IN MAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>France's state-owned Cie Generale
d'Electricite (CGE) is likely to be privatised during May this
year, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the group
would be privatised during the course of this year, when it
first announced the operation in early January, the May date is
earlier than the market had expected.
    As a result it will follow close on the heels of the
privatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertising
group &lt;Agence Havas>.
    Last month the government privatised the first of the state
financial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.P>, in a
floatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.
    And in December the first of the industrial groups, glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.P>, returned to the private
sector.
    CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications to
shipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck a
deal with ITT Corp &lt;ITT.N> to create the world's second largest
telecommunications group under the Alcatel name.

<TITLE>FIVE GROUPS APPLY TO BUY FRENCH TELEPHONE GROUP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Five consortia have applied to buy the
French state-owned telephone equipment manufacturer &lt;Cie
Generale de Constructions Telephoniques (CGCT)>, which will
give the owners control of 16 pct of the French telephone
switching market, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur said.
    The French government has given itself until the end of
April to decide which applicant will be accepted, they added.
    While several foreign groups have said they want to gain a
foothold in the French market, their potential stake in CGCT is
limited to 20 pct under privatisation laws passed last year,
with 80 pct to be left in French hands.
    The Finance Ministry sources gave no details of the groups
interested in CGCT, but several have publicly announced their
candidacies.
    U.S. Telecommunications giant American Telephone and
Telegraph Co &lt;T.N> which has been at the centre of the two-year
battle for CGCT, has teamed up with the Dutch-based &lt;Philips
Telecommunications Industrie B.V.>, a subsidiary of NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabriek &lt;PGLO.AS> and &lt;Societe Anonyme de
Telecommunications> (SAT) to present a joint bid, in
association with holding company Cie du Midi SA &lt;MCDP.P> and
five French investment funds.
    A second bid has come from the West German electronics
group Siemens AG &lt;SIEG.F>, which hopes to take a 20 pct stake
in CGCT, with the French telecommunications &lt;Jeumont-Schneider>
taking the remaining 80 pct.
    Sweden's &lt;AB LM Ericsson> has also submitted a bid for the
maximum 20 pct permitted, in association with French defence
electronics group &lt;Matra>, which would hold between 40 and 49
pct, and construction group &lt;Bouygues>.
    Matra has already acquired CGCT's private telephone
business.

<TITLE>SPEAKER SEEKING SUPPORT FOR U.S. TAX INCREASES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>House Speaker Jim Wright is lobbying
congressmen to support a plan to cut the 1988 budget deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through spending cuts and the
remainder through tax hikes, congressional sources said.
    He is backing a half and half plan and has made the
suggestion to Democrats on the House Budget Committee
privately, committee sources said.
    However, a committee source told Reuters that committee
Democrats already generally favor a plan to cut the deficit
about 40 billion dlrs, half through taxes and the Speaker's
move was seen as building support outside the committee.
    Wright's 20 billion dlr revenue raising plan has no
specifics, although he has floated a stock transfer tax and
also has suggested deferring tax cuts due to the wealthy.
    Neither of those plans has caught fire yet in Congress, and
some congressmen are cool to the idea of a stock tax.
    The Budget committee is considering a 1988 budget aimed at
reducing the estimated deficit of 170 billion dlrs as estimated
by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
    Committee Chairman William Gray has publicly backed a
budget cutting move of 40 billion dlrs but says that will not
reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target for 1988 of 108 billion
dlrs, although he claims it will be in the spirit of it.

<TITLE>TANZANIAN RAILWAYS SECURE 25.6 MLN DLRS AID</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-run Tanzania Railway
Corporation (TRC) has secured 25.6 mln dlrs aid from banks and
European countries for a one-year emergency repair program,
Transport Minister Mustafa Nyang'anyi said.
    Nyang'anyi told Reuters on his return from a World Bank
sponsored donors' conference in New York that the aid would
enable TRC to buy spares for 32 locomotives, overhaul 800
wagons and replace 67,000 sleepers over the next 12 months.
    The World Bank, African Development Bank, European
Community, Canada, Belgium, West Germany, Britain, Sweden,
Italy and Denmark had contributed to the package, he said.
    TRC runs a rail network linking Dar es Salaam and the
northern port of Tanga with the coffee-growing area around
Mount Kilimanjaro and ports on Lake Victoria and Lake
Tanganyika.
    It is under separate administration from the
Tanzania-Zambia railway linking Dar es Salaam with the Zambian
copperbelt and the railway system of southern Africa, which has
already received substantial aid as part of international
efforts to ease the dependence of landlocked African states on
trade routes through South Africa.
    But this is the first international aid package for TRC,
which also carries cargo for Uganda, Zaire and Burundi.

<TITLE>YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK , March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Responsibility for the appreciation of
the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with
those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter
    Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
their currencies against the dollar.
    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
with Taiwain and Korea.
    "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
concerned about how they are perceived in the international
business community," Yeutter said.
    For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
country.
    He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two
or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
prevails in Taiwan."
    Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50
billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not
sustainable.
    "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat
of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter
said.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS STRONGLY CRITICISE EC MILK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on
reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible
situation, French farm unions said.
    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of
planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut
milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm
union, the FNSEA, said.
    The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural
Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.
    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said
repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.
    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the
level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets
for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to
Rouen.
    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the
milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement
and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,
rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.
    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission
proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.
Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork
prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in
milk output.

<DATELINE>    BAGHDAD, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iraq said its forces killed or wounded
15,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards as they crushed a new
Iranian offensive near the strategic port city of Basra.
    A high command war communique said four Revolutionary
Guards divisions attacked Iraqi positions east of Basra on the
Gulf War southern front, but they were fully crushed by noon
(0900 GMT).
    Adbul-Jabbar Mohsen, chief of the defence ministry
political department, said the Iranians had 15,000 casualties.
    Iran earlier today said its forces launched fresh attacks
near Basra last night, adding that 1,200 Iraqis were killed or
wounded in fighting near Fish Lake, 10 km east of Basra.
    In its first reaction to Tehran reports of a new Iranian
offensive on the northern front, Iraq said fighting continues
around the strategic mountain peak of Kardamanend, overlooking
the Haj Omran-Rawandiz axis close to the Iranian border.
    A military spokesman said Iran launched its attack in the
north "to (turn) Iraqi attention towards that area and relax
pressure in the south."
    He added, "Iraq knows well that Iran's main goal is to
occupy Basra in the south and that was the reason why Iraq has
repelled their new offensive so decisively and firmly."
    Iran reported heavy fighting on both fronts today.

sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid
infection, the company said.
    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,
showed that two children suffering from the disease were
treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of
serious infection during that time, the company said. The
results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine
Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the
immune system.
    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme
with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to
disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,
preventing rejection.
    "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function
occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of
T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before
treatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.
    "The children are now more active and have begun to gain
weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very
poor in comparison to normal children of the same age," the
study, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca
Buckley, said.
    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of
the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow
transplants, but for most, donors are not available or
transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other
diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by
introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.

<TITLE>OCCIDENTAL &lt;OXY> OFFERS OVER 37 MLN SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Occidental Petroleum Corp said its
common stock offering has been further increased to a total of
37,950,000 shares.
    The company explained that underwriters exercised in full
their option to increase tohe offering by buying an additional
4,950,000 shares over and above the 33 mln brought to market
yesterday. Originally, Occidental had planned to offer 30 mln
shares. It had 165 mln outstanding prior to the offering.
    The underwriters are Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Kidder
Peabody and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc.
    At the public offering price of 30.50 dlrs a share,
Occidental said, the total value of the offering was nearly
1.16 billion dlrs, making it the largest underwritten common
equity offering by a U.S. natural resource company.
    The company said the significant financial improvements
from applying the net proceeds of the offering, principally to
the reduction of debt, along with its 1986 restructuring of oil
and gas operations and the acquisition of Midcon Corp have
positioned Occidental to benefit from an improving oil and gas
industry environment.

<TITLE>CONGRESS MAY CURB U.S. AID TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured U.S. farmers and miners.
    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing
to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, an
Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires that the United States vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a
provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared
Congress.
    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho
and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it
faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has
blocked its consideration by the House in the past.
    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

found a suitable firm, a spokesman said in reply to questions.
    Mannesmann managing board chairman Werner Dieter told the
business weekly Wirtschaftswoche in an interview that
Mannesmann wanted to invest in a U.S. Company in order to
strengthen its presence on the U.S. Market.
    Dieter said Mannesmann would act quickly when and if it
found a firm in which it wanted to take a stake.
    The Mannesmann spokesman declined to say in which
industrial sector the group may make a U.S. Acquisition or how
big the acquisition might be.
    He also said the group had not yet completed taking over a
stake in car components firm &lt;Fichtel und Sachs AG>.
    Mannesmann had said in January it hoped to take a 37.5 pct
stake in Fichtel und Sachs's holding company, Sachs AG, in the
first quarter. The spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of
intent on the takeover from the heirs of the company's late
owner but completion has been delayed by legal questions
concerning the inheritance.

<TITLE>ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings
for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market
conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.
    The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
    The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
volume.
    Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading
Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a
general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
stg from 205 mln in 1985.
    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd noted.
    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
lag, analysts said.
    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third
quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in
U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes
added.
    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty
flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
massive upturn," he said.
    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If
you are not exploring you are not going to find anything," he
noted.
    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
below 20 dlrs a barrel.
    This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC
marginal production shutting down. "OPEC has done pretty
extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,"
he added.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's
decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings
banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's
determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation
despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.
    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one
percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess
liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.
    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the
Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to
choke off money supply growth.
    "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said.
"It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates
and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."
    "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know
that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive
and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.
    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month
ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise
in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of
raising interest rates.
    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now
-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money
from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish
exports less competitive.
    The government says industry's competitiveness is also
being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was
way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the
European Community, which it joined a year ago.
    To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is
insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for
clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough
sacrifices.
    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose
demands essentially involve more government spending, have
become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.
    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have
some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the
money market too hard.
    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key
overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at
today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since
the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.
    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in
any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate
banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.
    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the
publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers
say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,
inevitably, push lending rates higher.
    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which
banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect
tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month
that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher
interest rates.
