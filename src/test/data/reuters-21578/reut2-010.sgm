<TITLE>BIOGEN &lt;BGNF> GETS PATENT FROM EUROPEAN OFFICE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Biogen Inc said the European
Patent Office granted it a patent covering certain proteins
used to produce a hepatitis B vaccine through genetic
engineering techniques.
    Robert Gottlieb, Biogen spokesman, said the company has
licensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to &lt;Wellcome PLC>,
the British pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensing
with other companies.
    Biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude others
from marketing hepatitis B vaccine in the 11 member countries
of the European Patent Convention.
    Gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in other
markets, including the U.S. The vaccine is in clinical tests.
    Patents in the biotechnology field are particularly
important as the company with an exclusive patent can reap
large rewards. Recently many of the products of genetic
engineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.
    Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK> already sells a genetically
engineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called Recombivax
HB. A subsidiary of &lt;SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKline
Biologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis B
vaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.
    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also been
formally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has been
authorized for market in a number of Far East countries.
    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in many
parts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15
pct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about
200,000 new cases occur each year.
    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen's
patent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appeal
once it receives a formal written opinion from the office.

<TITLE>KEY U.S. HOUSE MEMBER OPPOSES CFTC USER PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A key U.S. House member said he
opposed a Reagan administration plan to shift the cost of
surveillance of futures exchanges to the private sector.
    "I just think user fees are the wrong way to attack a
problem of this sort," said Rep. Ed Jones (D-Tenn.), chairman
of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
    The White House budget office has asked the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to draw up a plan for
transferring the three-mln dlr cost of monitoring futures
trading to either exchanges, futures commission merchants or
users of the markets.
    CFTC Commissioner William Seale said the proposal was a
move in the wrong direction. "I would prefer to see
(surveillance) paid for through the appropriations process
rather than through taxation of market participants," he said.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips told the panel the commission
was preparing the proposal, due to be completed April 15, at
the request of the Office of Management and Budget.

<TITLE>U.K. GROWING IMPATIENT WITH JAPAN - THATCHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade
barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against
countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.
    She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications
market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
    "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the
fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and
Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test
on how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said.
    Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall have
more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers
under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become
available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where
other countries do not offer the same full access to financial
services as we do."
    Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed
Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.
    But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications
was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless
having a managerial role in the new company.

Reynolds added.
    GenCorp said the plant will create 500 new jobs.

to climb above Dow Jones Industrial 2500 level by June.
    The Dow average is around 2380 today.
    "Liquidity is the biggest fundamental factor in the market

noting that the market's peak will occur in June.
    Feshbach said that in early January he predicted that the
Dow Jones Industrial average, the most closely watched market

<TITLE>LLOYD'S APPOINTS NEW OUTSIDE COUNCIL MEMBERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Four new outsiders were appointed to the
policy-making Council of the Lloyd's of London insurance
market, shifting the voting balance on the Council away from
Lloyd's professionals, Lloyd's said.
    It said in a statement the appointments of the new members,
none of them previously involved in the insurance market, were
made to comply with the core recommendation in the Neill report
into regulation at Lloyd's, which was published on January 22.
    The recommendation, one of 70 to improve investor
protection in the Lloyd's market, was to reduce the number of
elected working members, Lloyd's professionals, from 16 to 12.
    Simultaneously, the number of outsiders would be increased
by four while the number of external Council members, usually
Lloyd's investors without an active role in the market, would
remain unchanged at eight.
 Lloyd's said the four newly-appointed Council members were
barrister Elizabeth Mary Freeman, Sir Maurice Hodgson,
non-executive chairman of British Home Stores Plc, Lloyd's Bank
Plc chairman Sir Jeremy Morse, and Brian Pomeroy, an accountant
who sat on the three-member Neill enquiry panel.
    They replace the four Lloyd's professionals who resigned on
April 4 after Lloyd's agreed to implement the recommendation.

<TITLE>TALKING POINT/CONRAIL &lt;CRR></TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Private investors eagerly snapped up
shares of Consolidated Rail Corp, the biggest initial stock
offering in U.S. history, but some analysts warned they could
be in a for a bumpy ride at least in the near term.
    Analyst James Voytko of PaineWebber Group Inc believes some
investors who bought at the offering price of 28 dlrs will be
tempted to sell. The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.
Voytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the
35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously
bankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.
    "Conrail is in the best position to weather the current
tremendous price competition in the transportation industry in
general," said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,
a research firm.
    "It will survive and do damn well," said another analyst
who declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight
trains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major
U.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.
    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on
coal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail
to earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.
    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down
the road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be
distributed to current and former employees. He believes many
of these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.
    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the
average employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would
would not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would
create a big downward push on the price.
    "It's hard to call," said the analyst who requested
anonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate
individuals to keep their shares, he said.
    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,
believes the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is
able to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00
dlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by
1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed
for rail operations is invested wisely.
    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins
said, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at
conservative rates.
    He believes motor freight will be one area of
diversification Conrail will explore.
    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose
department was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that
Conrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot
defer necessary maintenance.
    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited
the New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor
wearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to
Stanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.
    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88
billion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees
and other adjustments.
    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next
five years is another issue troubling some investors.
    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb
from 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5
mln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession
year, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.
    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will
be 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and
exactly the same as in 1981.
    "Their basic business isn't going anywhere," he says,
explaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.
    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession
year. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a
recession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990
recession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20
dlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and
3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering
of the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.
    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26
dlr level.
    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. A
total of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate.

<DATELINE>    PONTIAC, Mich., March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United Auto Workers struck
General Motors Corp's truck and bus plants at Pontiac, Mich,
General Motors said.
    General Motors' truck and bus group failed to reach an
agreement on local issues with UAW Local 594 by the union's
deadline of noon today, causing a strike by 9,000 hourly
workers at the facility, the company said.
    General Motors said it was "eager" to continue meeting with
union officials on the dispute. It was not immediately clear
whether contract talks were continuing at the facility.
    General Motors spokesman Frank Cronin said the three plants
at Pontiac stopped working "as of noon today."
    He said talks will resume Friday at 1000 EST in Pontiac.
"We're hoping (the strike) will be of very brief duration,"
Cronin said.
    Bus-manufacturing operations at one of the three
plants--the Pontiac Central facility--are being sold to
Greyhound Corp &lt;G>, although GM will retain the facility.
    Cronin said about 400 workers on the bus line will be laid
off "whenever we fulfill production commitments" on the buses,
"possibly in May."
    The Pontiac Central plant also makes medium- and heavy-duty
trucks. Assembly of the medium trucks is scheduled to move to
Janesville, Wis., in 1990, Chronin said.
    Heavy truck operations at the plant will be taken over by
GM's joint venture with Volvo AB, and all vehicle assembly
operations at the facility will eventually be ended, Chronin
said. The plant also has sheet metal operations, which are so
far unaffected, he said.
    The other two plants at Pontiac--Pontiac East and Pontiac
West--make full-size pickups and sport utility vehicles.

<TITLE>CFTC OFFICIALS SEE NO MERGER WITH SEC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Officials of the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) said merging the agency with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not help
regulation of commodities and securities markets.
    "I don't think that a merger would solve regulatory
problems," CFTC chairman Susan Phillips told the House
Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
    "I think what does solve our problems would be working with
other agencies in a strong capacity," she said in response to a
question. "We don't want agencies to trample on our
jurisdiction either."
    CFTC Commissioner Fowler West said, "We ... do not have the
expertise to regulate securities markets. I don't think the SEC
has the expertise to regulate the futures markets."
    Increased attention to price volatility in stock index
futures markets and reports of alleged futures trading abuses
have raised concerns Congress may adopt a radically different
regulatory structure for securities and futures markets.
    Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over securities
regulation, has said he will hold hearings on the questions of
market volatility and alleged trading abuses.

<TITLE>POLAND FIRM ON ECONOMY DESPITE CONCESSIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Irena Czekierska, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WARSAW, March 26  - </DATELINE><BODY>The Polish government has backed down
from some proposed price rises in the face of strong opposition
from trade unions, but has restated its commitment to economic
reforms entailing tougher discipline and austerity measures.
    Following a warning from the officially-backed OPZZ unions
that sharp price hikes could spark confrontation, the
government has agreed that food prices this year will rise an
average 9.6 pct instead of the planned 13 pct.
    A statement last night said the government had "partially
accepted" demands for the protection of the low-paid and agreed
to extend some social benefits.
    But Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, at a separate
meeting yesterday, sharply criticised the slow pace of reforms.
    He told an economic commission that tougher discipline and
austerity measures, greater efficiency and initiative should
replace waste, red tape and inertia. He announced cost-cutting
measures affecting central administrative bodies.
    OPZZ economic expert Zbigniew Kochan welcomed the move on
food prices. "This decrease was considerable," Kochan told
Reuters today. "Also important is the fact that the government
admitted we were right and agreed to consult us over prices
from now on," he added.
    The communique made no mention of curbs on wage increases,
or price rises in sectors including transport and energy.
    The authorities have said prices could go up by as much as
26 pct as state subsidies are sharply reduced in an effort to
make the market more free and to improve efficiency.
    The OPZZ unions are officially recognised by the government
and replaced the Solidarity movement suppressed under martial
law. They claim a membership of seven million.
    Western diplomats said today the climb-down on food prices
was a limited concession. "This is a small price to pay if they
can push through the other price rises," one said, adding that
fuel and energy rises would have a more significant effect.
    He noted that there had been a concerted media campaign to
prepare people for price rises, including a major article in a
mass-circulation women's magazine, "clearly aimed at those who
do the shopping," he said.
    Other articles in the official press this week have focused
on coal, which sells to both industrial and private consumers
at far less than either the production or export costs.
    Countering scepticism from opposition sources and former
Solidarity activists as to OPZZ's role, Kochan said "It was
definitely not a question of gaining credibility, but true
concern for people's living standards."
    Deputy Prime Minister Jozef Koziol said the authorities'
main aim was not to harm workers' living standards. But he was
also quoted by the official PAP news agency as saying the
government had to take current economic realities into account.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Mobil Corp said it will spend over 30
mln dlrs to upgrade a gasoline-producing unit at its Beaumont,
Texas, refinery.
    It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts
low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components
for use in Super Unleaded gasoline.
    The company said the modernization will allow the unit to
regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown.
Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces
46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will
start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989.

<TITLE>CFTC LIMIT PLAN MAY NOT REVERSE LIQUIDITY DROP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>A proposal by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futures
speculative positions for certain agricultural commodity
contracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in those
markets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.
    Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a House
Agriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have the
effect of raising deferred month speculative position limits on
several agricultural commodity contracts would not
substantially increase liquidity in those months.
    "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits will
create a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Seale
told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
    Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a
1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment of
so-called straddles limited the ability of futures commission
merchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commission
would take into account Congress' recommendation that federal
speculative limits be raised.
    The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica Commodity
Exchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan would
decrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts.

<TITLE>VOLVO 1986 RESULT OFF SLIGHTLY FROM 1985</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STOCKHOLM, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>AB Volvo &lt;VOLV.ST> said the weakening
dollar caused the drop in its 1986 profits, but company chief
executive Pehr Gyllenhammar said 1986 was one of Volvo's best
years ever.
    In its final report released earlier, the company said the
group's 1986 profits before allocations and taxes was 7.53
billion crowns  compared with 1985's 7.60 billion.
    Despite the fall, Gyllenhammar said, "Sales of industrial
products have never been higher, and Volvo Cars and Volvo
Trucks were both completely sold out at year-end. Operating
income was slightly higher than a year earlier."
    He said the company's financial strength gave it
exceptional opportunities to invest for the future.
    Although industrial sales were up, the company's yearend
report said total sales were 84.09 billion crowns against
1985's 86.19 billion.

<TITLE>REPORT EXPECTS SHARP DROP IN WORLD IRON IMPORTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>World seaborne iron ore imports will
fall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC
and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South
East Asia, a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said.
    The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports
of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985.
    It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron
ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct, or 200 billion tonne
miles, with shipping demand associated with the coking trade
down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles.
    The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in
2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89
mln from 124.6 mln tonnes. Imports to South East Asia are seen
rising to 58.6 mln from 32.6 mln tonnes in 1985.
    It predicts that EC steel production will fall to 109 mln
tonnes in 2000 from 135.7 mln in 1985 with Japanese production
falling to 92 mln from 105.3 mln.
    South Korea and Taiwan are expected to double their output
to 40 mln tonnes with Chinese production increasing by 25 mln
tonnes to 80 mln, it added.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dun and Bradstreet Corp said business
failures in February increased 10.8 pct, to 5,390, from 4,864
in February 1986.
    "The national level of business failures continues to be
driven upward by substantial increases in the oil and
agricultural states," Dun said.
    Dun said that of the nine U.S. Bureau of the Census
regions, three reported a decrease in the number of failures
and two had gains of less than 3.0 pct.
    The largest increase was reported in the West South Central
states, Dun said, with business failures rising 47.8 pct, to
1,218.
    The East South Central states posted a 44 pct rise, to 298,
Dun said, while the West North Central states recorded a 27.3
pct gain, to 489.
    The greatest decline, Dun reported, was registered by the
Middle Atlantic states, down 8.2 pct in February, to 324.
    The Pacific states also reported a large decline in failing
businesses, off 6.8 pct, to 1,028, Dun said.
    In the smokestack region of the East North Central states,
there was a negligible decline of 0.6 pct, to 794, Dun said.
    Dun said the Mountain states recorded a gain in business
failures of 1.5 pct, to 530.
    Business failures in the New England states rose 23.5 pct,
to 105.
    By industry segment, Dun said the largest gain was recorded
by the agricultural, forestry and fishing sector, up 62.7 pct,
to 345.
    Year to date, Dun said business failures rose to 11,004, an
increase of 5.3 pct over 1986.

<TITLE>FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal Reserve Board Governor
Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth."
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
"loot the bank" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

yielding 9.15 pct, said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures have a 9-1/8 pct coupon and were priced at

Morgan Stanley co-managed the deal.
    The issue is non-refundable for 10 years.  A sinking fund
beginning in 1998 to retire annually five pct of the debt may
be increased by 200 pct at the company's option, giving it an
estimated minimum life of 13.85 years and maximum of 20.5
years. The debt is rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB-plus by S/P.

<TITLE>CFTC SEES NO TRADING, TRIPLE WITCHING RULES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The chairman of the CFTC, Susan
Phillips, said she does not expect the CFTC to restrict dual
trading or to intervene in the quarterly expiration of stock
index futures and their options.
     "At this time we have no plans to reexamine our policy (on
dual trading)," she told the House Subcommittee on
Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
    She said it would not be appropriate to ban dual trading
because it would decrease market liquidity.
    Dual trading refers to the ability of futures commission
merchants to trade for their own as well as their clients'
accounts. Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting to
benefit from the market impact of a client's order by trading
on his own account before placing the client's order.
    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to have
implemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of all
trades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part to
discourage abuse of dual trading.
    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
has proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in the
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.
    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiring
improved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns about
dual trading abuses.
    "It would be inappropriate at this point until we see how
the audit trail will work," she said in response to a question.
    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments by
markets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successful
and that users of securities and derivative instruments were
still learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.
    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of
stock index futures, options on those futures and options on
certain individual stocks.
    The CFTC chairman noted the commission has heightened
surveillance of markets on triple-witching day.
    "We aren't sure any other regulatory changes are needed at
this point," Phillips said.

of liquid yield option notes.
    Also downgraded were the unit Trinity Industries Leasing
Co's 60 mln dlrs of convertible debentures due 2006 to BB-plus
from BBB-minus.
    S and P said the actions reflected Trinity's weakened
earnings due to depressed demand in several key markets, the
likelihood that a significant sustained improvement would not
occur in the near-term, as well as heightened financial risk
from a series of debt-financed acquisitions.

<TITLE>ADMINISTRATION SAYS INSURANCE CRISIS EASED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration said the
national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past
year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to
11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.
    An administration working group, in an update of its report
a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have
stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.
    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the
insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the
same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,
the group said in a 98-page study.
    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability
insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be
difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some
sectors of the American economy.
    Some types of insurance, especially associated with
environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies
at any price, it said.
    The increased availability and the price stability for
insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher
deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy
restrictions, the study said.
    The administration last year unveiled a wide range of
recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including 
limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and
mental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.
    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference today
that the administration still supports state efforts to place
limits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tort
laws.
    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied charges
by consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused by
industry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrust
laws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive
jury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance
liability problem.

<TITLE>FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY PLEADS GUILTY TO TAX EVASION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 26 - </DATELINE><BODY>Former Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Anderson, whom Dwight Eisenhower once said deserved to
be president, pleaded guilty to income tax evason charges and
illegally running an offshore bank.
    Anderson, declaring that he was "deeply regretful," admitted
to evading tax on 127,500 dlrs in undeclared income.   Much of
the money was paid to him for lobbying for controversial South
Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
    The 77-year-old Anderson was President Eisenhower's
treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 and a prominent
businessman afterwards. In his memoirs, Eisenhower said
Anderson deserved to be president.
    Standing before Federal Court Judge Edmund Palmieri,
Anderson, who faces up to 10 years in jail, said he had
recently undergone two operations and treatment for alcoholism.
    The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that
Anderson be sent to jail.
    According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of
the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the
British West Indies for two years ending in 1985.
    During that time, government prosecutors said the bank
conducted operations in New York city but failed to register
with state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have
lost at least 4 mln dlrs.
    Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but
admitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and
faces civil fines for both years.
    Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983
from a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification
Church. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan
repayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been
reported as income.
