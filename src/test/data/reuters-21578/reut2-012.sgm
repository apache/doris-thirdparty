<TITLE>SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Nelson Graves, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Speculation the United States will
offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
    Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
markets since officials from the two countries held their
customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
    Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
    Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
preparing an offer.
    Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
    But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
while not a "done deal," is a live possibility.
    Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
    Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
are saying they would not rule one out.
    Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
to two weeks.
    Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
who had been in contact with administration officials.
    Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
offer would be made by the middle of this month.
    Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
    Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
    As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
would appear to be price.
    Last summer the administration took the controversial step
of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
far above world market prices.
    The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
criticism, grain trade sources said.
    Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
from saying the Soviets were "chortling" because Washington was
offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
U.S. housewives.
    The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
here is that a general warming of relations between the two
countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
    In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
    However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
subsidy offer last summer.
    Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
    Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
include only the Soviets.
    That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

<TITLE>ICO QUOTAS BEFORE OCTOBER UNLIKELY - DELEGATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The restoration of coffee export quotas
before the end of the current 1986/87 coffee year (Oct 1/Sept
30) now seems unlikely, given reluctance by International
Coffee Organization, ICO, producers and consumers to resume
negotiations on an interim quota accord, producer delegates
told reporters.
    Consumers and most producers see no point in reopening the
quota dialogue while Brazil's position remains unchanged, they
said.
    Brazil's refusal to accept a reduction in its previous 30
pct share of the ICO's global export quota effectively
torpedoed talks here last month aimed at restoring quotas
before October, the delegates noted.
    Disappointment at the lack of progress on quotas forced
coffee futures in London and New York to new lows today,
traders here said. Near May in New York fell below one dlr in
early trading at around 99.10 cents per pound, traders said.
    Producer delegates said that while the possibility of
reimposing quotas before October remained on the ICO agenda, in
practice the idea had effectively been discarded.
    The ICO's executive board session here this week has so far
barely touched on the quota debate, demonstrating general
unwillingness to revive talks while chances of success are
still remote, producer delegates said.
    Some producers are in no hurry to see quotas restored,
despite the price collapse seen since the failure of last
month's negotiations, they said.
    "With Brazil's frost season approaching, who wants to
negotiate quotas," one leading producer delegate said.
    Coffee prices normally rise during Brazil's frost season
(mainly June-August) as dealers and roasters build up stocks as
insurance against possible severe frost damage to Brazil's
crop.
    Many producers are more interested in working towards
reimposing quotas from October 1, based on a new system of
quota allocations valid until the International Coffee
Agreement expires in 1989, they said.
    Guatemala has already proposed the "other oilds" producer
group should meet in the next two months to begin talks on how
to allocate quota shares.
    Producers still seem divided on how to overhaul the quota
distribution system, with some producer delegates reporting
growing support for a radical reallocation, based on the
principle of "objective criteria" favoured by consumers.
    At last month's council session a splinter group of small
producers backed consumer demands for new quota shares based on
exportable production and stocks, while Brazil, Colombia and
the rest of the producers favoured leaving quota allocations
unchanged, except for some temporary adjustments.
    A delegate from one of the eight said more producers now
supported their cause.
    The delegate said unless major producers like Brazil showed
readiness to negotiate new quota shares, prospects for a quota
accord in October also looked bleak.
    The U.S. and most other consumers are still determined to
make reimposition of quotas conditional on a redistribution of
quota shares based on "objective criteria."
    ICO observers remained sceptical that Brazil would be
prepared to accept a quota reduction when the ICO council meets
in September.
    Brazil has adopted a tough stance with banks on external
debt negotiations and is likely to be just as tough on coffee,
they said.
    They said Brazil's reluctance to open coffee export
registrations might reflect fears this would provoke another
price slide and force an emergency ICO council session, which
would most likely end in failure.
    Producers met this afternoon to review the market situation
but had only a general discussion about how further
negotiations should proceed, a producer delegate said.
    Producers plan to hold consultations on quotas, and then
may set a date for a formal producer meeting, but plans are not
fixed, he said.
    The ICO executive board reconvened at 1650 hours local time
to hear a report from consultants on ICO operations. The board
meeting looks set to end today, a day earlier than scheduled,
delegates said.

<TITLE>YUGOSLAVIA WINS TIME IN PARIS CLUB REFINANCING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BELGRADE, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Yugoslavia has won breathing space from
its major official creditors through yesterday's Paris Club
refinancing agreement but it will take time for it to resolve
its economic crisis, economists at western embassies said.
    Yugoslav delegation chief Finance Minister Svetozar
Rikanovic said a refinancing was agreed for 475 mln dlrs of
debt falling due between May 16 this year and May 31, 1988.
    The agreement was the second multi-year Yugoslav debt
refinancing, based on a protocol signed last May which ushered
in "enhanced monitoring" of Yugoslavia's economy by the IMF.
    Western economists who follow Yugoslav financial affairs
said a similar deal would probably emerge from talks with
commercial creditors at the end of this month. But they said
the refinancings would only provide a breathing space, because
Yugoslavia has to repay 5.5 billion dlrs in 1987.
    And the country is still struggling to reverse a dramatic
decline in export earnings, which have fallen 12.5 pct so far
this year, continuing a downward spiral of the past 18 months.
    The Yugoslav hard currency debt has grown from 1.2 billion
dlrs in 1965 to stand at 19.7 billion dlrs at the end of 1986
and is one of the country's most dire economic problems.
    The debt began to snowball in the 1960s and 1970s due to an
excessive investment rate exceeding the growth of the Gross
Social Product and necessitating additional foreign borrowing.
    Rising international oil prices in the 1970s proved to be a
serious blow to the country's balance of payments.
    Deputy Prime Minister Milos Milosavljevic said this month
that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325
mln dlrs of interest so far this year.
    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a
record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986,
reducing overall indebtedness by 996 mln dlrs.
    Mikulic is trying to rein in rampant retail inflation of
almost 100 pct a year through price and incomes controls.
    Janez Zemljaric, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said
recently Yugoslavia expected a "definite measure of
understanding" from its 16 major western creditor nations.
    Western economists said Yugoslavia has had its way with the
Paris Club creditors but that not all creditors were satisfied
with its economic performance last year. They said the Paris
discussions were heated and emotional.
    "Economic factors were balanced by political realities," an
economist at one of the main embassies here said, but added
that creditors had no complaints regarding Yugoslavia's
repayment record because it had so far always repaid debts on
time.
    Yugoslavia has refinanced its debt regularly since 1983.
    In December 1985, it signed a deal with the International
Coordinating Committee of 600 commercial banks to refinance
maturities arising between January 1, 1985 and end-1988.
    It had signed bilateral refinancing agreements in March of
that year for maturities arising from January 1, 1985 to March
25, 1986, following an agreement in Paris on March 25, 1985.
    Government ministers told Reuters this month that
Yugoslavia had made too great an effort to repay its debts in
1986, at great cost to the economy, and that this was
regretted.
    Mikulic has said Yugoslavia is unlikely to follow Brazil's
lead and suspend its debt repayments "but we have understanding
for what that country did."
    Western economists said, however, that Mikulic's remarks,
taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal that some
problems were seen ahead in refinancing debt repayments.
    Before the Paris talks, some Yugoslav officials had hinted
that Yugoslavia could start to look to the Soviet Bloc for
financial support if Belgrade failed to secure the necessary
refinancing from western creditors.
    Sources close to the western creditors, however, said they
did not view the threat as serious.

<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Le Matin, the French-language tabloid
launched here in February, said it is shutting down its
operations because it can no longer get financing.
    The paper, launched by private investors, was Montreal's
fourth French-language newspaper and was aimed at readers with
above average incomes and educations. It had a daily
circulation of about 20,000 copies.
    Le Matin was printed and distributed by (Southam Inc)'s
Montreal Gazette newspaper. A Gazette spokesman said his
newspaper is Le Matin's biggest creditor but he declined to
reveal the amount of debt
    Acting publisher Jean-Pierre Bordua said the newspaper's
bank blocked its lines of credit after three of the paper's
senior managers resigned Friday.

<TITLE>TOWLE &lt;QTOW> STOCK MAY BE DILUTED, CANCELED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, Mass., April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Towle Manufacturing Co, in Chapter
11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, said any plan of reorganization
would likely lead to a dilution or cancellation of its common
and preferred stock.
    The company also said claims for subordinated debentures
would likely be paid at less than their 100 pct of their face
value, and general unsecured claims would likely be paid
without interest. The company has not yet filed a plan of
reorganization.
    The company said it lost 22 mln dlrs from operations in
1986 against a loss of 67.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The company also said its independent accountants
disclaimed an opinion on the financial statements for 1986
because of questions about its contination as a going concern.
    The company said, however, it substantially restructured
its business, reducing borrowings on an outstanding credit line
to 16.5 mln dlrs in 1986 from 57 mln dlrs a year ago. The
company also cut its staff to 820 employees at the end of 1986
from 2,500 a year earlier.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA COULD BE FIRST TO FEEL U.K. TRADE ANGER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, the Japanese
electronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalised
telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first
casualty in the current war of words over trade between Japan
and the U.K., Government and industry sources said.
    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading
practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without
unleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems most
unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are
looking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.
    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it
wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key
telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over
telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for
switching calls within a business, industry sources said.
    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over
Japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to
foreign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one
official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.
    Tomorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal
action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the
U.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent
Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significant
position in a new Japanese international telecommunications
venture. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.
    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the
issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese
rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials
said.
    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had
no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign
telecommunications firms a bigger role there.
    The government, for which competition and the deregulation
of markets are major political themes, is unlikely to make
final decisions tomorrow on how to act against Japan, officials
said.
    Detailed consideration of the issue has been shelved during
Thatcher's official visit to the Soviet Union, which ends
today.
    "We are waiting for the Prime Minister to decide what to do.
The DTI will pass the ball to her as soon as she returns
tonight," a DTI official said.
    He said Toshiba's application would be considered by the
Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL). An OFTEL spokeswoman said
"a decision on this application will take weeks, maybe months."
    Asked whether Toshiba's bid would fall victim to British
retaliation, the OFTEL spokeswoman said: "Who knows what's going
to happen given the current situation!"
    A Toshiba executive, who asked not to be named, told
Reuters: "We do not anticipate any special problems."
    Some analysts queried by Reuters questioned the basis of
Britain's strong stand on the Cable and Wireless bid. One said
that the company's proposal was equivalent to a Japanese
company wanting to take a stake in Mercury International, the
subsidiary of Cable and Wireless that is the only real
competitor of British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>.
    British Corporate Affairs minister Michael Howard leaves
for Japan on Saturday.
    The minister will seek a clear timetable from Japan for
easier access for British institutions to Japanese financial
markets, reciprocating the easy access Japanese securities
houses and banks have to the City of London.
    Britain has threatened to use its new Financial Services
Act to revoke or deny licences to Japanese brokerage houses if
it does not get satisfaction.
    But British authorities would be far from happy if forced
to use that weapon, government sources said.
    Sir Nicholas Goodison, Chairman of the London Stock
Exchange, said in New York yesterday that sanctions against
Japanese financial institutions operating in the U.K. Would set
back London's ambition to become a leading centre for corporate
financing and securities trading.
    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson also warned
yesterday of the negative effects that a trade war could have
on the British economy. Such a development could hit U.K.
Exports and sharply alter the outlook for the next general
election in which economic recovery will be one of the
government's main themes, political analysts said.

<TITLE>DOLLAR EUROBONDS END EASIER ON PRIME RATE RISES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Pizzey, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The dollar straight sector of the
eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day's trading as
U.S. Banks began to match yesterday's surprise 1/4 point prime
rate hikes by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, dealers said.
    The prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the
timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. However, reaction
here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4
point easier, while longer dates dipped by 1/4 to 1/2 point.
    In the primary market, activity again centred on currencies
other than the U.S. Dollar, dealers noted.
    One dollar straight dealer at a U.S. Securities house
commented "There was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but
only in small sizes." He added that, ironically, the prime rate
rises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose on
the back of the news.
    The only U.S. Dollar deal launched during the day was, as
has been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-year
convertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has an
indicated coupon of two pct. One source at a house involved in
the deal said, "It's got to be a blow-out. With a name like this
you're talking about Japan Inc."
    The lead manager was the Bank of Tokyo International (BOTI)
and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109
pct. A BOTI official said "We've had worldwide interest in the
deal."
    She noted the Tokyo stock market had experienced a mild
correction at the beginning of the week but that bank stocks
were hardly affected.
    The yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straight
deal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for France's Caisse
Nationale des Telecommunications. The state guaranteed five
year bond pays 4-3/8 pct and was priced at 101-1/2 pct.
    The issue was lead managed by IBJ International Ltd and was
quoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct compared
with the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. One syndicate official at a
firm not involved in the deal said "It's tight, but overall I
would say its fairly priced."
    Also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a total
redemption amount of 19 billion yen for Rural Banking and
Finance Corp of New Zealand. It was priced at 81.22 pct and
lead managed by Nomura International.
    In the Australian dollar sector, GMAC (Australia) Finance
Ltd issued a 50 mln Australian dlr bond.
    Hambros Bank Ltd was lead manager for the four-year deal
which pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. It was
guranteed by General Motors Acceptance Corp and was quoted on
the 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.
    McDonalds Corp issued a 75 mln Canadian dlr bond paying
8-1/2 pct over five years and priced at 101-5/8 pct. It was
quoted around the 1-7/8 pct fees at less two less 1-3/4 and was
led by Morgan Guaranty Ltd.
    The European Investment Bank launched a 300 mln Danish
Crown, seven-year, bond withan 11 pct coupon and pricing of 101
pct. It was lead managed by Den Danske Bank.
    The floating rate note sector basically ended easier
following the increase in period eurodollar deposit rates
prompted by the prime rate increases, dealers said. But they
noted that mis-match deals - issues whereby the coupon is
re-fixed on a monthly basis - were firmer.

said its board approved a modernization and expansion program
from its petrochemical division, USI Chemical Co, its
polyethylene producer.
    The program will add 600 mln pounds per year to USI's
existing capacity of 3.2 billion pounds, the company said. The
increase will result from the addition of two linear reactors
based on fluid bed gas phase technology for the production of
linear low density or high density polyethylene at locations in
the Midwest and Gulf Coast, it said.
    Plans are in the engineering stage with completion expected
in mid 1989, the company said. In addition, USI is presently
constructing a 300 mln pound linear low density polyethylene
facility, scheduled to come on stream in early 1988 at its Port
Author, Texas, plant.

<TITLE>BRAZIL CONFIRMS RENEWAL OF SHORT-TERM CREDIT LINES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRASILIA, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Brazilian economic officials confirmed
a renewal of short-range credit lines by commercial creditors,
bringing optimism that renegotiation of the 109 billion dlrs
foreign debt is possible.
    Finance Ministry sources said a "large majority" of foreign
banks had accepted to extend Brazil's credit lines before the
midnight deadline of March 31 for payment of 15 billion dlrs
servicing expired.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro told reporters all short
range credit lines were renewed, "without exception."
    Central Bank sources, although incapable of confirming that
100 pct of the banks had renewed the credit lines, said that
there was a massive affirmative reply.
    The credit lines were extended in their majority by 30
days, but there were banks which renewed the deadline by 90
days and, sometimes, by 180 days, Funaro told reporters.
    Brazil is pledging for an extension of the deadlines for an
indefinite period, until its economic officials seek a global
renegotiation of the debt.
    Last week Brazil had suggested to creditors an extension of
the deadline for another two months, until May 31.

<TITLE>TOSHIBA COULD BE FIRST TO FEEL U.K. TRADE ANGER</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Sten Stovall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>, the Japanese
electronics group which plans to enter Britain's liberalised
telecommunications equipment market, risks becoming the first
casualty in the current war of words over trade between Japan
and the U.K., Government and industry sources said.
    U.K. Authorities have lost patience with Japanese trading
practices and said they are seeking ways to retaliate without
unleashing a damaging trade war. "Toshiba's timing seems most
unfortunate for the company, as it comes exactly when we are
looking for someone to punch," one official told Reuters.
    Earlier, &lt;Toshiba Information Systems (U.K.) Ltd> said it
wanted to enter the British business facsimile and key
telephone market. A facsimile machine sends printed data over
telephone lines, while a key telephone system is used for
switching calls within a business, industry sources said.
    The move by Toshiba comes in the middle of a dispute over
Japan's refusal to open up its telecommunications market to
foreign companies. "Toshiba's timing is most extraordinary," one
official at the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said.
    Tommorrow, the U.K. Government will consider what legal
action it can possible take to press for Japanese reform.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has given notice that the
U.K. Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent
Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> from taking a significant
position in a new Japanese international telecommunications
venture. "We regard this as a test case," she told Parliament.
    But while the U.K. Is keen to see some movement on the
issue by Japan, it is also worried that recent anti-Japanese
rhetoric may cause developments to get out of hand, officials
said.
    Japanese officials in Tokyo today reiterated that Japan had
no plans to bow to U.K. And U.S. Pressure to give foreign
telecommunications firms a bigger role there.

<TITLE>DIAMOND SHAMROCK &lt;DIA> SEES BETTER 1987 EARNINGS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, APRIL 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Diamond Shamrock Corp, which will split
this month into two separate companies, expects to show
improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new
company told Reuters.
    Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of
Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize
exploration and production, said, "Earnings wil be better than
in 1986." He declined to say how much better.
    In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs
on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and
production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.
    Roger Hemminghaus, Diamond Shamrock vice president and
soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock
Refining and Marketing Co, said, "Refining and marketing is a
margin business. The margins will return and this will be a
better year than 1986."
    In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of
40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.
    "We are also expecting to be in the black in the first
quarter (1987)," Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986,
the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln
dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.
   
    The executives were in New york for meetings with
institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the
company's stock.
    On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was
trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.
    Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share
for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at
17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing
operation to its shareholders.
    "Our advisors convinced us the market would give higher
multiples for pure plays," Blackburn said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the U.S. imposition of tariffs on Japanese goods over
semiconductor trade does not signal the start of a trade war.
    He also played down the significance of the precipitous
stock market decline earlier this week.
    "I don't think this action should be interpreted in any way
as the start of a trade war," he said in response to a question
from a House Appropriations subcommittee.
    He said a drop in stock market prices of the magnitude
experienced Monday was not so unusual.
    "I don't think it is particularly unusual to see those kinds
of days" on Wall Street, Baker said.
    Since Monday, he added, "The stock market has rebounded
rather vigorously."
    He urged lawmakers to move cautiously on trade legislation
to avoid overly protectionist moves which might aggravate world
trade tensions.
    "You're not going to legislate this (trade) deficit away," he
told the panel.

<TITLE>ARCO &lt;ARC> UP ON HIGHER EARNINGS ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>Atlantic Richfield Co's stock rose
sharply after analyst Eugene Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc
raised his earnings estmates of the company, traders said.
    ARCO jumped 1-3/4 to 81-3/4.
    Nowak said that based on an average oil price of 17 dlrs a
barrel in 1987, the company should earn about 4.50 dlrs a
share. Next year, based on an average oil price of 18 dlrs a
barrel, ARCO should earn about five dlrs a share. The company
earned 3.38 dlrs a share in 1986. "If oil prices should rise to
an average of 20 dlrs a barrel," he said, "ARCO could record
earnings of 6.50 dlrs a share.
    Nowak said his increased estimates come after the company
told analysts yesterday that its first quarter earnings will
comfortably cover its quarterly dividend requirement of one dlr
a share.
    Nowak said, "The company has done an outstanding job
reducing expenses, and ARCO is poised to generate greater
earnings power." He said first quarter earnings will likely
exceed the company's expectations stated yesterday and be in
the 1.15-1.20 dlr-a-share range.

<TITLE>U.S. SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, April 1 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Has been promised a near
monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries
guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an
EC official said.
    The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that
the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the
agreement.
    Under the accord, which began in January, third countries
were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln
tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as
300,000 tonnes of sorghum.
    However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that
almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.
    The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a
tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to
authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.
    EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from
outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable
terms than that from the U.S.
    No Commission spokesman was immediately available for
comment.

Soviet Union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with delivery
spread out from March to June, the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Counselor in Buenos Aires said in a field report.
    The report, dated March 27, said many sources have stated
that the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing
2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from Argentina.
    However, Soviet purchases from the United States have
tended to displace additional Argentine purchases, the report
said.
    The USDA has to date reported USSR purchases of 2.6 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the current U.S.-USSR grain
agreement year, which ends this September 30, it said.
