<TITLE>FIDATA &lt;FID> ANNOUNCES PRELIMINARY ESM SETTLEMENT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fidata Corp &lt;FID> and its subsidiary,
Fidata Trust Company New York &lt;FTCNY>, announced that they have
reached a preliminary settlement agreement in principle in the
lawsuits filed by major parties arising out of the E.S.M.
Government Securities, Inc bankruptcy.
    Fidata Corp said that it anticipates that the cost of the
proposed settlement, after anticipated recoveries, will be less
than 4 mln dlrs, and possibly significantly less.
    The major terms of the settlement agreement, applicable to
Fidata and FTCNY, provide for the release by Fidata of its
claims to 1.125 mln dlrs held by the ESM estate, and the
further payment of 8.425 mln dlrs for distribution to the
public body plaintiffs and Home State Savings Bank.
    Fidata said it expects to recover along with its subsidiary
at least half of the sums to be paid under the terms of the
agreement, and potentially amounts substantially in excess of
that.

<TITLE>LOWER REFINERY OPERATIONS SEEN PRODUCING PROFITS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By BERNICE NAPACH, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. refiners will have to
reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year, said
industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here.
     "If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine
about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day, we have a chance to
pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second
quarter, said Archie Dunham, executive vice president of
petroluem products at Conoco Inc
    "If not, the industry will have a tough 1987," he added.
     Last week's American Petroleum Institute report said that
U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity,
with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week
ended March 20.
     The API said that with the higher crude oil runs, 
distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago
levels. Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels, some 17.2
mln barrels above year-ago levels. Distillate stocks, at 108.7
mln barrels, are 10.9 mln barrels above last year's level, the
API said.
     Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp
&lt;CNP> told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to
profitability, oil companies will have to rely on downstream
operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings.
     "The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it
continues," said Kenneth Buckler, executive vice president of
refining and marketing at &lt;Total Petroleum Co>, a U.S.
subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France.
     Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given
the current level of demand but the operating level should
increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter,
Buckler said.
     Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S.
refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude
per day. "I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries
over the next five years," he said, adding that these
facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude
oil per day. The API said U.S. operations have the capacity to
refine 15.6 mln bpd of crude.

<TITLE>SONY INCREASING PRODUCTION ABROAD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> will increase production
abroad to overcome falling profits caused by the yen's rise
against the dollar, managing board chairman Akio Morita told
the West German newspaper Die Welt.
    He was quoted as saying that Sony, whose latest profit
figures had been affected strongly by dollar fluctuations,
would increase production in the U.S. And Europe.
    Several production facilities were being built, he added.
"At the same time we are also investing capital in order to
modernise our locations and raise our productivity."
    Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems,
Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live less
from exports and more from domestic demand.
    He said U.S. And European companies had made the mistake of
not investing enough in the future, which was why they had lost
their lead in consumer electronics.
    "They may spend a lot of money on research and development,"
he said. "But planning and marketing are very important sectors
in developing a marketable product."
    "If they don't spend money on these, they can't build up new
business lines."
    Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience in
penetrating the Japanese market, Morita said "Naturally, I have
to admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan."
    On the other hand, many foreign firms were too interested
in short-term success, he said.
    "If, therefore, a company comes to Japan and wants to make a
profit at once on this market, it is not so simple."
    "These people then complain, while the successful firms keep
their mouths shut," Morita said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Senate has approved a
measure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks
to write off loan losses over ten years.
    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was
attached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.
    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks
with assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of
total loans in farm loans -- to write down over ten years
agricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATE BUDGET CHIEF EYES FARM POLICY CHANGE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Lawton Chiles' (D-Fla.) fiscal 1988 budget plan would
cut farm spending by about two billion dlrs, primarily by
making unspecified changes in price and income support
programs, Senate staff members said.
    Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week and
said he would like to begin voting on it this week.
    Senate Republican staff members said Chiles was
recommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.
    While savings from the changes would accrue mainly in
fiscal 1989, Chiles said his income and price support proposals
would trim about two billion dlrs from advance deficiency
payments, most of which would be made in the spring of next
year.
    It was not clear how the Senate Budget panel head would
achieve the savings in Commodity Credit Corp outlays. Aides to
Chiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.
    Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a report
listing possible price and income support program savings.
    The options included lowering target prices, increasing
unpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income support
payments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use of
generic commodity certificates, raising loan rates and
"decoupling" income support payments from production decisions.
    Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing the
U.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functions
which include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.
    The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrs
for organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid.

<TITLE>NEWMONT MINING &lt;NEM> SEEKS SOUTH AFRICAN SALE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 10 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp will seek
favorable terms for sale of its South African investments, the
proxy statement for its annual meeting said.
    Recommending that shareholders vote against a proposal
calling expeditious withdrawal from South Africa, the proxy
said "a quick sale could be akin to abandonment" because of the
depressed state of metal mining stocks and exchange rates on
capital withdrawals from South Africa.
    The proxy said the company gave close consideration to
alternatives to the continued holdings of four existing South
African metal mining investments during the past year.
    Pointing out "a measurable number of investors incline to
support" resolutions calling for South African divestment as
part of their effort to avoid pressure to sell a given stock,
the company said "this largely unspoken agenda of many
supporters of disinvestment does receive attention by the
corporation."
    Because of this, Newmont Mining said it "is prepared to
consider, and will seek, favorable terms for sale of its South
African investments," but asked stockholders to reject the
resolution calling for withdrawal and leave the matter to the
continuing judgment of management.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA WANTS TO BOOST ITS REFINING CAPACITY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Venezuela's state oil
company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. wants to raise its
worldwide refining capacity by 150,000 barrels of per day, a
company official attending the National Petroleum Refiners
Association meeting here said.
    He declined to be identified but said PdVSA has the
capacity to refine about 650,000 bpd of crude oil from refining
centers
in Venezuela, Sweden, West Germany, Belgium, and the United
States. The company recently purchased a 50 pct stake in the
Corpus Christi, Texas refinery of Champlin Petroleum Co, a
subsidiary of Union Pacific Corp &lt;UNP>.
    Earlier it bought a similar stake in the Lake Charles, La
refinery owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a unit of Southland
Corp &lt;SLC>.
     According to the official, Venezuela is searching
worldwide for the additional refining capacity but he did not
mention where the company was looking. 
    Refineries abroad, he said, guarantee a refining outlet for
Venezuelan crude oil while ensuring stability of supply to
refiners.
    He said Venezuela currently  produces about 1.4 mln bpd of
crude oil, which is in line with its 1.495 bpd OPEC ceiling.

<DATELINE>    TROY, MICH., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Audi of America Inc said it
introduced the "Audi Private Purchase Plan" in which it will
offer 5,000 dlr purchase certificates exclusively to current
owners of 1984-86 Audi 5000 vehicles.
    It said owners must apply the certificates toward purchase
or lease of any new 1987 Audi 5000 series vehicle.
    The program will run between April 1 and June 30, and more
than 150,000 certificates will be mailed.
    A company spokesman said eligible owners need not trade in
their old cars to take advantage of the offer.
    He also said the scheme was not prompted by the fact that
Audi had to recall thousands of its cars earlier this year to
correct a possible defect that caused some of the cars to
accelerate suddenly.

<TITLE>BASS GROUP SAYS IT HAS HAD TALKS ON TAFT &lt;TFB></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group led by members of the
wealthy Bass family of Fort Worth, Texas, which holds a 24.9
pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, said it has had talks about
taking part in a move to take control of the company.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it has had discussions with other Taft
stockholders and some company managers and directors
"concerning participation in a group to acquire control" of the
company.
    The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other
people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to
continue evaluating Taft and "will be involved in further
discussions relating to the future control and direction" of
the company.
    The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said
its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may
decide to sell some or all of its stake.
    On Friday Taft said it would negotiate with a group led by
its vice chairman, Dudley Taft, and a Rhode Island investment
firm, which had offered 150 dlrs a share for the company.
    The Dudley Taft group, Theta Corp, which also includes
Narragansett Capital Corp, a Providence, R.I., investment firm,
is seeking to take the company private in a leveraged buyout
valued at 1.38 billion dlrs.
    Besides the Bass group, another major Taft shareholder,
Cincinnati, Ohio, financier Carl Lindner, has also said he has
had talks about increasing his stake in the company, taking
part in a takeover effort, or launching one himself.
    Lindner controls 1,489,298 shares of Taft common stock, or
16.2 pct of the total.

<TITLE>HIGH COURT DECLINES TO REVIEW AIR BAG RULE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Supreme Court declined to review
a federal regulation requiring automobile manufacturers to
phase in automatic seat belts or air bags for new cars sold in
the United States.
    The Department of Transportation (DOT) rule required that
the safety devices be installed, for the first time, on 10 pct
of this year's model cars. All new cars must have the devices
by the 1990-model year.
    The regulation, however, can be rescinded if states with
two-thirds of the U.S. population adopt mandatory seat belt-use
laws by 1989.

<TITLE>TRADE BODY SETS NEW RULES FOR EURODLR MANAGERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    London, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears."
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations," he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrower
says to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'" he said.

<TITLE>TRANSAMERICAN FILES AMENDED REORGANIZATION PLAN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp, which
has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
January 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiated
plan of reorganization.
    A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas.
    Basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated plan
have not changed from the original plan filed last October, the
company said.
     The amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents to
the plan filed in October, it said.
    Assuming the plan is found adequate on April 29,
TransAmerican would then seek acceptance from creditors which
is relatively assured since they participated in the
negotiations, the company said.
    Liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are being
reorganized under the amended plan which provides for full
debt-repayment to secured bank lenders.
    Unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment,
secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25
to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation of
the plan by the court.
    TransAmerican is vigorously resisting efforts by Coastal
Corp &lt;CGP> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan of
liquidation.
    The spokesman said the company is confident its plan will
be confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from Chapter
11 as early ninety days after the April 29 confirmation.
    A Coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in April with
the court and will request the court to review its plan.
    On March 17, the company said that as a creditor, which is
owed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan which
will better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.
    A TransAmerican spokesman said the net worth of Coastal's
offer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value of
Transamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.

<TITLE>TEXTRON &lt;TXT> TO REPAY DEBT THROUGH ASSET SALES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texton Inc said it intends to
repay a substantial portion of the debt generated to acquire
Ex-Cell-O Corp last year through internally generated cash and
proceeds from the sale of assets.
    Textron financed the acquisition by borrowing about one
billion dlrs under promissory notes, subsequently refinanced
through the sale of commercial paper and bank borrowings.
    The large diversified conglomerate with operations ranging
from defense to consumer and financial services, said in its
annual report that it has not yet identified the units, other
than its Gorham division, it expects to sell.
    Textron said it did expect to identify the units it intends
to sell during the next year. It said the sales are expected to
reduce income from continuing operations as the units' earnings
will exceed the interest on the debt retired with the proceeds
of the sales.
    It also said it plans to "return to a more conservative
balance sheet ratio of debt-to-capital," through asset sales
and increasing cash flow from continuing operations.
    It also said it will continue to examine "large acquisition
opportunities," while "pruning" operations no longer expected
to meet its strategic requirements.

<TITLE>NEWMONT MINING &lt;NEM> SETS HIGHER SPENDING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Newmont Mining Corp estimates its 1987
capital spending at 137 mln dlrs, its annual report said.
    A company spokesman said this figure excludes &lt;Magma Copper
Co> and compares to spending of about 80 mln dlrs in 1986
excluding the 45 mln dlrs spent on Magma operations. As
previously announced, Newmont is distributing 80 pct of Magma's
stock to its shareholders in the form of a dividend.
    The report also said Newmont Mining increased its ownership
of Du Pont Co &lt;DD> stock during 1986 to 5,970,141 shares at
year end from 5,250,376 shares a year earlier.
    Newmont's annual report said the company held 2.5 pct of Du
Pont's stock at the end of 1986, up from 2.2 pct a year
earlier.
    The report also said Newmont's proven oil reserves declined

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed Banner Industries Inc's 135 mln dlrs of B-minus
subordinated debt following its purchase of Rexnord Inc. 
    Rexnord's 50 mln dlrs of 12-3/4 pct debentures of 1994 were
cut to B from A-minus to reflect the merger with Banner.
    While increasing Banner's size and diversity, S and P said
the transaction heightens financial risk, with debt to capital
rising to more than 90 pct.
    Near-term earnings and cash flow protection will weaken
from the acquisition, though Banner's plans to sell some
Rexnord assets will reduce debt for the medium term.

<TITLE>LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    New York, March 30 - </DATELINE><BODY>Texas' cotton crop stands little
chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in
that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according
to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.
    "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct
of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,
a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in
Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had
begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with
planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to
begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for
60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,
Stillmann said.
    Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop
to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande
Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,
according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.
    The price of new-crop cotton on the New York cotton futures
market rallied today on weather-related fears.
