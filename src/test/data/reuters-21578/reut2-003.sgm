<TITLE>U.K. MONEY MARKET SHORTAGE FORECAST AT 250 MLN STG</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of England said it forecast a
shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today.
    Among the factors affecting liquidity, it said bills
maturing in official hands and the treasury bill take-up would
drain around 1.02 billion stg while below target bankers'
balances would take out a further 140 mln.
    Against this, a fall in the note circulation would add 345
mln stg and the net effect of exchequer transactions would be
an inflow of some 545 mln stg, the Bank added.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France said it invited offers
of first category paper today for a money market intervention
tender.
    Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for the
Bank to cut its intervention rate at the tender by a quarter
percentage point to 7-3/4 pct from eight, reflecting an easing
in call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness
on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency
stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.
    Intervention rate was last raised to eight pct from 7-1/4
on January 2. Call money today was quoted at 7-11/16 7-3/4 pct.

<TITLE>SOUTH KOREA DELAYS CONTRACT FOR NUCLEAR PLANTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SEOUL, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Technology transfer problems have delayed
the finalising of contracts between South Korea's state-owned
Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco) and U.S. Firms for supplies
of equipment and services for Kepco's latest two 950-megawatt
nuclear power plants, a Kepco spokesman said.
    He told Reuters the contracts for Kepco's tenth and
eleventh stations, costing between two and three billion dlrs,
were due for completion by the end of February.
    Kepco has been negotiating with Combustion Engineering Inc
(CSP) for pressurised light-water reactors and General Electric
Co (GE) for turbines.

    KEPCO has also been negotiating with (Sargent and Lundy
Engineers) for engineering and design consultancy services.
    "We have been waging a tug-of-war on the transfer of
advanced technology. But I am optimistic we will sign contracts
with them within this month," the spokesman said.
    He said the transfer of advanced technology is vital for
South Korea, which wants to build future nuclear power plants
with its own technology.
    Work on the two plants is due to start about June 1988 for
completion in 1995 and 1996, although the sites have yet to be
chosen, he said.

cut its base lending rate  0.5 percentage points to 10.5 pct
today.
    National Westminster said that it was responding to general
easing in money market rates.
    Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier
this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the
base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last
week that such a move would be premature.
    However, since then the pound has continued to gain
strongly.

<TITLE>U.S. TO ALLOW TEMPORARY IMPORTS OF S.A. URANIUM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Treasury Department said it would
temporarily permit imports of South African uranium ore and
oxide pending clarification of anti-apartheid sanctions laws
passed by Congress last fall.
    The decision was announced late Friday. It applies, until
July 1, to uranium ore and oxide imported into the U.S. for
processing and re-export to third countries.
    The Treasury said it took the action because it felt that
when Congress passed the comprehensive South African sanctions
bill last fall over President Reagan's veto it had not intended
to hurt U.S. industry.
    In addition, the Treasury said it would permit U.S.-made
goods to be imported temporarily from South African
state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing.

    It quoted law enforcement officials with knowledge of the
investigation as saying special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, who
is investigating the scandal, was focusing on three areas.
    The paper identified these as conspiracy to defraud the
government, obstructing justice and making false statements to
the government. It said the prosecutor had not ruled out any
suspects, including current and former government officials.

<TITLE>NYSE RULE COULD AFFECT TRADING IN LONDON</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>An existing New York Stock Exchange,
NYSE, rule might be used to limit the trading activities of its
members in London in stocks listed on both exchanges, sources
at the London Exchange said.
    This could arise if the London Stock Exchange goes ahead
with plans to close its trading floor.
    The London Exchange sources were commenting on press
reports that the NYSE would bar its members firms from trading
on the London Exchange in interlisted stocks during periods
when the NYSE was open.
    The London exchange is seeking clarification.
    London Exchange sources said the possibility of
restrictions on NYSE members appears to reflect a rule which
requires that exchanges recognised by the NYSE possess a
trading floor.
    Last month, the London Exchange said in a statement that it
planned to close its floor in due course, apart from a floor
for traded options, because almost all business is now being
done by screen and telephone between brokerage offices.
    This development stemmed from the Big Bang restructuring of
the market on October 27. The demise of the traditional Stock
Exchange floor has been widely expected, though no date has
been set as yet.
    Market sources said a compromise over the NYSE rule could
well be reached, partly because the interests of U.S.
Securities dealers are not all identical.
    Some of them could well start lobbying the NYSE, pointing
out, among other things, that the expansion of global trading
needs to be based on reciprocal arrangements.
    NYSE brokerage firms which also trade on the London
Exchange would presumably be put at a disadvantage over
non-NYSE U.S. Firms, which  have affiliates on the London
Exchange, market sources said.

<TITLE>PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> AGREES TO USAIR &lt;U> BUYOUT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>USAir Group Inc said Piedmont Aviation
Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
    Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines
Inc &lt;TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
    The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's
application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
application failed to comply with department regulations by
omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile
today, providing the information needed.
    On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares
or 15 pct of USAir.

<TITLE>U.S. AIDES SEE MOSCOW AGREEING TO ARMS CHECK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior U.S. Arms control officials
said they were optimistic the United States and Soviet Union
could reach agreement on ways to verify a pact to eliminate
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
    Chief U.S. Arms control negotiator Max Kampelman said on
the NBC television network a fair pact would be hard to
negotiate, but, "We are determined to do it."
    Assistant Secretary of Defence for international security
policy Richard Perle said he thought the two sides could agree
on a method to ensure each side was honouring a missile pact.
    President Reagan said on Friday that Secretary of State
George Shultz would go to Moscow next month for talks on arms
control and a possible U.S.-Soviet summit meeting.
    The decision to send Shultz to Moscow followed an
announcement by Soviet leader Mikhael Gorbachev that he was
willing to separate elimination of medium-range missiles in
Europe from his demand for curbs on U.S. Development of a
Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) anti-missile system.
    Kampelman said the United States and the Soviet Union both
had a general definition of so-called "intrusive" or on-site
inspection of a pact, but details would be tough to work out.

    Of the January total, 1.15 billion stg was advanced on bank

    On a three-month basis, total advances in November to

    The department said advances on credit cards rose by 1.0
pct between the latest two three-month periods. Retailers
advanced 3.0 pct less in the latest three months than in the

<TITLE>OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 24 nations of the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
    The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
    It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
hit by currency appreciation this year.
    The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
    It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
    It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
    It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
    The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
increasingly ragged.
    It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at
1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate
is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
    "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper
angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
rather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.
    "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
U.S. Fsical policy," it said.
    It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
    "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding
that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar
would collapse.
    To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
crisis, it said.
    On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
"increasingly sick."
    Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
    The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
December, the EIU said.
    On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
competitively-priced dollar.
    It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.

<TITLE>POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Allan Saunderson and Antonia Sharpe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
similar move, banking sources said.
    The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium
in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
representatives were not invited.
    The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
    "It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," said
one banker who attended the symposium.
    A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
    But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a
direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
    "He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"
the second source said.
    In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut
in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
a move in advance, the sources said.
    Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by
cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
"No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that."
    The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
    Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying
that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
    For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
    The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted
growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
current levels by international central bank cooperation.
    One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact
that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
West Germany's economic growth.
    Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
stressed that the German central bank had no direct
responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
combatting inflation.
    This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
half-point cut in rates in late January.
    The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
    Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's
main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
    Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish
outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,
brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

<TITLE>VENEZUELA REVEALS DEBT PAYMENT SCHEDULE DETAILS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CARACAS, March 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling
accord Venezuela signed a week ago will reduce its payments
over the next three years by 64 pct, according to Finance
Ministry figures released this weekend.
    A ministry statistical analysis said while the original
accord called for payments of 3.82 billion dlrs between 1987
and 1989, the new agreement requires debt servicing of 1.35
billion over the same period. In 1987, Venezuela will be
required to pay 250 mln dlrs instead of the 1.55 billion
originally agreed. Payments in 1988 were cut to 400 mln from
1.20 billion, and in 1989 to 700 mln from 1.11 billion.
    The ministry's analysis said the reduction in debt
servicing during 1987-1989 amounts to an effective grace
period, something the Venezuelan negotiators sought from
creditor banks but were not granted.
    Most of the rescheduling falls during 1994-1998, when 53.3
pct, or some 11.25 billion dlrs, must be paid. Under the
February 27 accord, Venezuela will repay 20.3 billion dlrs of
public sector debt over 14 years at 7/8 of a percentage point
over London interbank offered rates (Libor).
    This compares with the February 1986 accord which called
for a 12-year term and interest of 1-1/8 point over Libor.

<TITLE>SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW></TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company
formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>,
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>,
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.
    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
or removal of directors.

<TITLE>DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch economic growth is slowing as a
firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries
reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning
agency CPB said.
    The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic
outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to
grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in
1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.
    Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20
billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase
from last year's 423.95 billion.
    The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of
the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct
last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average
of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.
    "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit
labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while
these are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.
    More of economic growth now depended on domestic
consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set
by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on
purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.
    Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the
CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.
    Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five
pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last
year, the CPB said.
    Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to
condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent
years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of
these factors on Dutch competitiveness.
    In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social
security costs to employers.
    The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2
pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,
urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down
the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in
future.
    Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by
falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.
    It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this
year from 710,000 last year.
    While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is
within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two
pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.
    Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in
its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant
prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts
had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own
latest estimate.
    "It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole
document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some
of our estimates," a Pierson economist said.
    The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in
1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy
exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.
    Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with
four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.
    The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the
surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1
billion last year, the CPB forecast.

<DATELINE>    ROY, Utah, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Iomega Corp said it has laid off over
a quarter of its professional and management staff and nearly
half of its direct labor force as part of a restructuring and
downsizing of its business.
    The company also said it will receive a qualified opinion
from the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to the
outcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in a
consolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in an
unspecified amount and is also a defendant in a related
shareholder action.
    Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter that
both actions are in the early stages of discovery and the
likely outcome can not be determined at this time.
    The company said a corporate wide reduction of its
professional, management and indirect labor will result in the
permanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areas
of the company's business. This represents over 25 pct of
professional, management and indirect employees, it added.
    In addition, Iomega announced layoff of about 182
employees, principally from its manufacturing direct labor
force. Those affected represent about 46 pct of direct labor.
    Commenting on the layoffs, Iomega said those from among the
direct labor force affects personnel building the Alpha Eight
Inch Disk Drive and Bernoulli Boxes.
    "This action is required as we bring our finished goods
inventory and inventory in our distribution channels down to
acceptable levels," it explained.
    The company stated this layoff does not affect the
production of its new 5-1/4 inch Beta 20 product which is
currently being built to a backlog of orders.

<TITLE>TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ground-breaking new systems for storing
and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for
computer companies and computer users.
    Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines
Corp &lt;IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and others have launched
products that radically increase the amount of data that can be
catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.
    "This flurry of new technology could yield systems that
handle a multimedia blitz of data," said Ian Warhaftig, a
senior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.
    "We're developing new systems because our customers are
asking for them," Peter Giles, vice president and general
manager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recent
interview.
    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While
estimates vary, industry analysts project that providing
products and services geared for information storage and
retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by
1995.
    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the
varying requirements of users.
    For example, a large credit verification service would want
a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and
relay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a
computerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,
is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability
to store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be
crucial.
    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward
converting information - documents, video or film or even sound
recordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones
understood by computers.
    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for
storage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk
can store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of
typewritten text.
    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or
CD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,
Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program
that contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,
thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.
    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most
are specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's &lt;LOTS>
CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts
and investors. "Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it
marks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,"
said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.
    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record
and read data, is that that it requires a special player.
CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this
year.
    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated
with personal computers.
    "Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box," he
said. "Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and
thesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word
processing program."
    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak
unveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The
largest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to
150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter
of seconds.
    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8
gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The
Kodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of
1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large
amounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.
    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips &lt;PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics
giant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step
further with the first disk that can combine text, video and
sound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,
will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM
player that can hook up with a television set and stereo.
     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next
generation of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month
IBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing
more data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, &lt;Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.
    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several
years away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume
production of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.
    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers
with immense memory capacities.

<TITLE>BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE DESPITE COURT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hundreds of marines were on alert
at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain
on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court
Saturday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.
    The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years,
started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not
return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners
have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.
    "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the
workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our
protest until the end," a union leader said.
 more
    He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines
take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and
let the marines handle the situation by themselves.
    A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to
send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister
Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national
security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has
cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.
    Petrol station owners in four states also continued their
shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two
stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.

<TITLE>BANKING TRADE GROUP SAYS BANK PROFITS DOWN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Bankers Association said
the profitability of the nation's commercial banks declined by
12 pct during the first three quarters of 1986.
    During the first nine months of last year, the industry's
annualized rate of return on assets dropped to 0.68 pct from
0.77 pct in the same period in 1985, the ABA said. Return on
equity fell to 10.8 pct from 12.3 pct the previous year.
    Despite the decline in profits, the ABA said banks' capital
grew boosting the industry's capital ratio to 6.4 pct from 6.3
pct.
    The number and size of banks losing money during the period
increased significantly, the ABA said.
    During the first nine months of 1986, 17.5 pct of banks,
holding 9.6 pct of banking assets, were unprofitable, the group
said. That compares with 13 pct of banks, holding 8.8 pct of
assets, during the same period in 1985, it said.
    The industry's provisions for loan losses increased to 0.73
pct of assets during the period, up from 0.59 pct of assets
during the same period in 1985, the group said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>PAPER INSTITUTE SEES STRONG PAPER MARKET IN '87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The American Paper Institute said the
industry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,
with linerboard particularly strong.
    "A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currency
management, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax
increases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," Red
Cavaney, American Paper Institute president said.
    Cavaney said that so far this year the industry's
performance mimics last year's strength.
    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a
record 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, while
industry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.
    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in
this year's performance.
    "Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive
factor in the industry's outlook this year," he said, citing
market pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at
the low end of the industry's long term average.
    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in
1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as
a whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.
    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be
strong, spurred by consumer spending.
    The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax income
and consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increase
demand for both communications paper and packaging this year.
    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support
high levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for
many kinds of packaged goods.
    Inventory building should help demand for cartons and
corrugated containers this year, he added.
    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in
1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar
against major world currencies.
    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade
in 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial
activity at home and thus higher packaging demand.
    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower
costs, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also
contribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.
    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986
could have a negative impact on the industry this year.
    "For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax
credit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.
    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three
billion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result
of reforms.
    "Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful
evaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending
decisions of individual companies," Cavaney said.

<TITLE>BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany takes "very seriously" the
recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
    Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
for stabilising currencies.
    But he noted the official communique said the participants
agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
rates around current levels. "We're taking this sentence very
seriously," he said.
    Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
the mark since the meeting.
    He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
agreement should help in this respect.
    Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
had not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.
    Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.
    The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
country to stimulate economic activity.
    Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed
in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
    He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a
recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up
slightly during the course of the year.

<TITLE>UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KAMPALA, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee
producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee
talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing
Board, CMB, said.
    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a
situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of
robusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on
Friday.
    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula
to share the world's coffee production during International
Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.
    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were
suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its
quota be increased dramatically.
    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from
coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --
had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln
60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.
    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25
pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over
three mln bags.
    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO
export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.
    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for
about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs
over half of salaried manpower.
    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock
Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World
countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee
talks.
    "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.
    Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within
two months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegations
have had time to report back to their headquarters, common
sense will prevail."

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>National Westminster Bank Plc said it has
cut its base lending rate  0.5 percentage points to 10.5 pct
today.
    National Westminster said it was responding to general
easing in money market rates.
    Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier
this afternoon that it would endorse a half point cut in the
base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last
week that such a move would be premature.
    However, since then the pound has continued to gain
strongly.

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By WALKER SIMON, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    QUITO, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

opening today on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement
(INRA) depends on how flexible consumer countries are.
    Rubber producer and consumer countries meet for 12 days in
Geneva from tomorrow to try to hammer out a rubber pact after
they failed to reach agreement last November to replace the
current accord, which expires next October.
    Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said in a
statement that Malaysia wants to continue with a second INRA
and is prepared to accept modifications that would strengthen
the present agreement.
    He said the second INRA would allow for an orderly disposal
of the accumulated buffer stock of 375,000 tonnes, since the
market is now capable of absorbing such releases.
