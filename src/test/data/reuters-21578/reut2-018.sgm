<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>REAGAN SAYS VOLCKER WILL NOT SERVE NEW TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>President Reagan said Paul Volcker has
declined to serve another term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, the U.S. central bank. Reagan
nominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place.
    Volcker's term expires in August.
    Reagan, in a brief announcement in the White House briefing
room, said he accepted Volcker's decision "with great reluctance
and regret."
    Volcker, first appointed to the Fed post by President Jimmy
Carter in 1979, said "there is a time to leave and a time to
come ... I have no feeling I was being pushed."
    Volcker, appearing with Reagan, Greenspan, and Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the briefing room, said he will remain
on the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by the
Senate.
    In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him,
Greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's
greatest achievements was reducing inflation.
    "It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain
that those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring that
will be one of my primary goals," Greenspan said.
    Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of
Volcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line on
inflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.
    Immediately following Reagan's announcement, the U.S.
dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both
the bond and stock markets declined.
    But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, which
has fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its low
point.
   
    "There certainly is evidence in that direction," Greenspan
said when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.
    The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise
because the announcement followed a number of published reports
that the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker.
    Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of major
inflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10
per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per
cent.
   
    With Reagan's backing, Volcker pursued a tight money policy
that cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced
interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.
    The tight money policies were also blamed for producing
a deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political
problems for Reagan.
    Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.
   
    Greenspan, who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm,
was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers
from September 1974 until January 1977.
    Greenspan, a Republican, is considered a traditional
conservative economist and has been an adviser to several
presidents.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Belgium's public expenditure deficit
fell sharply to 59.5 billion francs in May from 96.7 billion in
the same month last year, the first major sign of the effects
of the government's public spending curbs, the Budget Ministry
said.
    During the first five months of this year, the net
government financing requirement was down by 44.1 billion
francs from year ago levels at 345.8 billion francs, it said in
a statement.
    The government is aiming to cut this year's financing
requirement to below 420 billion francs this year from around
560 billion in 1986.
    The Ministry said it was expected that more than half the
projected cut should have been achieved by the end of July.
    Ministry sources noted that for technical reasons, the
financing requirement is always highest in the early months of
the year.

<TITLE>PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ISLAMABAD, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Pakistan says its economy has continued
its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
investments and energy were causing concern.
    GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
to a government economic survey.
     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
and there was an impressive performance in a five point
government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
alleviation, said the survey.
    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
    The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
    Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
    More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
home remittances, he said.
    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
the boost in exports.
    He said national investment continued to be small because
of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

    Hutton led a group that won the bonds in competitive
bidding. It bid them at 99.376, representing a net interest
charge to the company of 9.94 pct.
    The underwriter set a 9-7/8 pct coupon and reoffering price
of 99.85 to yield 123 basis points more than comparable
Treasury securities. Non-refundable for five years, the bonds
are rated A-1 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard and Poor's.
    The gross spread is four dlrs and the reallowance is 2.50
dlrs, bookrunner Hutton said of the Virginia Electric deal.
    Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market in
October 1986 when it sold 100 mln dlrs of same-rated,
same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. That issue was priced to yield
9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.

<TITLE>ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's barley crop is generally in good
condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the
agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
said.
    First consignments were expected to be available around
mid-June.
    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
because of extreme dryness.
    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
    If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved
in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an
increase of 11 pct compared to 1986.

<TITLE>EC FARM MINISTERS DISAGREE ON DIRECT INCOME AIDS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    GENVAL, Belgium, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Plans to provide direct income
aids for European Community (EC) small farmers to help them
face deep cuts in guaranteed crop prices received a mixed
reception from EC agriculture ministers, EC officials said.
    The plans were discussed at an informal meeting of the
ministers hosted in the village of Genval by the Council of
Ministers' current chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker.
    The EC Executive Commission has proposed that the richer
member states be allowed to make direct payments to their
farmers in special difficulties, while the EC itself would
finance a similar scheme in the poorer EC countries.
    However, EC officials said only the Netherlands and
Luxembourg supported this idea at today's meeting, and France,
Denmark and Belgium showed marked hostility to it.
    French minister Francois Guillaume told reporters, "Farmers
should not become recipients of public assistance -- their
survival should be assured by price mechanisms and the market."
    The officials said the ministers had not sought to resolve
their more urgent differences over guaranteed farm prices for
1987/88 at this meeting.
    The ministers will resume talks on the price fixing issue
in Luxembourg on June 15.

    A company spokesman said members of Local Two of the

contract.
    Meanwhile, about 100 Teamster drivers and warehouse
employees, whose contract expired May 16, remained out, the
company said. No new talks were scheduled, Sara Lee said.
    Details of the new contract were not immediately available,
but a company spokesman said it "maintained benefits and called
for no sacrifices from current employees."
    Union sources reported that the contract freezes wages and
introduces a sharply lower starting rate for new hires. They
said it also gives Sara Lee concessions on a workplace issue
involving excused absences.

<TITLE>CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A representative of the poultry
industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
salads and other mixed foods.
    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries
and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House
Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
increase in outbreaks of the disease.
    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that
between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
    May said the chicken industry favored moving away from
bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
of poultry.
    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
necessary to avoid illness.
    Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry
inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.

to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
    A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
floor last week.
    The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
be changed.
    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending
into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to
meet stiff resistance in the full House.

<TITLE>EC BUDGET MINISTERS SET TO REFUSE PLEA FOR CASH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUXEMBOURG, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>A plea for extra cash to bail the
European Community (EC) out of its latest financial crisis was
likely to be rejected at a meeting today of EC budget
ministers, diplomats said.
    The ministers were meeting for the first time since the EC
Executive Commission unveiled an emergency budget for 1987
aimed at plugging a deficit caused by soaring farm spending and
falling revenues.
    The emergency package includes a demand for member states
to pay an extra 1.5 billion European currency units (Ecus) to
help meet the deficit.
    Officials said Britain and West Germany were expected to
lead opposition to contributing any extra cash, with the U.K
insisting instead on a clampdown on runaway farm spending.
    The Commission says there will be a shortfall of at least
five billion Ecus this year, more than 1/8 of total spending.
    It hopes to make up much of the shortfall in a one-time
accounting exercise by paying member states in arrears rather
than in advance for their spending on Community farm policies.
    But if member states do not make up the rest of the gap,
the Commission has warned that spending on regional and social
projects could be slashed by half.

than previous official figures during the past year of
emergency rule.
    A government spokesman said the latest set of names,
presented to parliament, included all current detainees who had
been held for over a month. Previous lists have named up to
8,500 people.
    The official figure was supported by civil rights groups
who said many detainees had been freed in recent weeks,
possibly to empty cells for a new government crackdown.

<TITLE>JAPANESE FARMERS PROTEST OPENING MARKETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Thousands of farmers gathered in central
Tokyo to urge the government to stand firm against foreign
pressure for further opening up of Japan's markets to foreign
agricultural products, union officials said.
    Officials of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives
said about 5,000 representatives from 4,200 farming groups
joined the demonstration.
    The organisers said the farmers demanded that the
government should avoid easy compromises on liberalising
agricultural imports at next week's economic summit in Venice.
    The United States and the European Community want Japan to
remove tariffs and quotas to help cut their trade deficits with
Japan.
    Under a banner reading "The government and parliament must
not sacrifice farmers," the demonstrators adopted a declaration
saying they would fight any unreasonable moves to open Japanese
markets to foreign agricultural products.
    An agriculture ministry official said Japan and the United
States were expected to hold talks on Japanese import ceilings
for U.S. Beef and citrus fruit in September.

<TITLE>FRESH DEBATE ON NORWAY'S EC MEMBERSHIP WELCOMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>     OSLO, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>European Community officials welcomed
Norway's recent move to renew a public debate on Community
membership but said Norway should not expect special trade
advantages as long as it stays outside the EC.
    Belgian Willy de Clercq, EC Commissioner on external
affairs and trade policy, said high level talks this week with
Norway's minority Labour government had helped clarify several
misconceptions that led to Norway's narrow rejection of EC
membership in a 1972 referendum.
    "But you (Norway) cannot be in the club and remain outside
the club. You can expect equal footing in the club, but not out
of it," de Clercq added, referring to Norway's attempts to adapt
its EC trade ties in the face of Community moves to launch an
internal trade market from 1992.
    The government, worried that the internal market will
hamper trade with the EC, which takes about two-thirds of
Norway's exports, last month sent a report to parliament asking
political parties and the public to reassess the country's
relationship to the EC.

<TITLE>VOLCKER IN LETTER DECLINES NEW FED TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Following is the full text of Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President
Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed:
    Dear Mr. President,
    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate
new appointment.
   
    In that connection, you will recall that, upon my
reappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm
commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a
second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the
time, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do
think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now
come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably
convenient and consistent with an orderly transition.
Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I
plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to
assume office.
   
    I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for
your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your
consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a
particularly challenging period for it, for the financial
system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever
success we have had.
   
    Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those
involved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the
nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal
Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering
economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring
to that effort a combination of sound and independent
professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan
considerations.
   
    May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder
of your own term in office during which you have done so much
to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the
American people.
    Faithfully yours,
    Paul A Volcker

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The scale of foreign exchange intervention
the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been
playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
pressures there are from time to time."
    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson
said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

<TITLE>CSFB ECONOMIST SAYS VOCLKER'S RESIGNATION A SHOCK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ZURICH, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The decision by Paul Volcker not to serve
a third term as chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is a
shock for financial markets and the world economy, Hans Mast,
senior economic adviser to Credit Suisse First Boston, said.
    "The markets will believe there will be pressure for a more
expansive policy (in the United States)," he said.
    "I would say this is quite a shock for the world economy," he
added. "He always stood for an anti-inflationary policy and
tight fiscal discipline. He was one of the best central bankers
America has had."
    Mast said the markets would now be trying to assess what
sort of direction the Fed would be taking under Alan Greenspan,
designated to succeed Volcker.
    "Greenspan is more of a politician than an academician, but
the most important thing is that he has little experience in
banking," Mast said.
    Greenspan's first comments on being named were that the
dollar appeared to have bottomed out but Mast said that
conviction would have to be backed by policy. "How can you say
the dollar has bottomed out with the present level of current
account deficits?" he said. "I would be sceptical."

<TITLE>SHEARSON ECONOMIST SAYS VOLCKER EFFECT SHORT-TERM</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Alan Sinai, chief economist of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, said news that Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker declined to accept reappointment would have only a
short-term effect on financial markets.
    "The markets should not go into a panic," Sinai told a
fixed-income conference in New York sponsored by the Institute
for International Research.
    Sinai said he thought that Volcker was one of the best Fed
governors in the country's history. Still, he predicted that
the markets would calm after today's tremors.
    Alan Greenspan has been nominated to replace Volcker.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
of Kansas said Alan Greenspan would be a good replacement for
Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve Chairman.
    "While Paul Volcker's retirement is a real loss, this
country is very fortunate to have a man of Alan Greenspan's
caliber to take his place," Dole said in a statement.
    "Alan's knowledge of the economy, coupled with his
experience at the top levels of government, means that the
leadership of the Federal Reserve Board will be in good hands.
Alan, literally, has some big shoes to fill. But I haven't any
doubts he's more than equal to the task," Dole said.

<TITLE>U.S. ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
    "I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable," Hodel told the
Senate Energy Committee.
    Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
    Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.
