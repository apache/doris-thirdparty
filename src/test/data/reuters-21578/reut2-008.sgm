<TITLE>LDC FOOD AID NEEDS DECLINE IN 1986/87 - USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Total food aid needs in 69 of the
least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments
fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the
department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a
record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.
    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by
drought-reduced crops and civil strife.
    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat
consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding
varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat
is a common crop, it said.
    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,
such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central
America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and
improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the
department said.
    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in
1986/87 for the third straight year.
    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil
consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department
said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, MARCH 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department 
formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to
drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
for the cut with targeted income payments.
    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
the "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,
Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration
wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.
    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
government for the price support cut with targeted income
payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would
cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.
    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.
John Porter, R-Ill.
    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
politically-influential sugar and corn growers
and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.
    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment
any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.
    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower
would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3
cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.
    The income payments would be based on the amount of
commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.
    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
in the sugar program because the current high price support is
causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.
    He said the current program has artificially stimulated
domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
corn sweeteners to make market inroads.
    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only one
mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar
refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.
    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives
overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a
competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of
sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing
facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.
    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said
consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
necessary for sugar.
    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
facing," Myers said.
    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per
lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons
recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to
compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

<TITLE>LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The USDA monthly cold storage report
for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on
livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of
direction, livestock analysts said.
    The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the
22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may
provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.
    "I think the market is going to be looking at some other
things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might
be early next week," Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH
Miller, said.
    Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures
will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog
marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was
completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest
for pork in general next week.
    "We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert
a possible setback next week in the pork complex," Levitt said.
    Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly
figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were
down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average
expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline
from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings,
they said.
    However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in
storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is
a potentially bullish situation.
    Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri,
said, "I would not look for (belly) storage during the next
month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be
less."

<TITLE>STRIKE THREAT, LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jane Arraf, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 20, Reuter - </DATELINE><BODY>The St. Lawrence Seaway, set
to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year
because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the
first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials
said.
    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes
of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal
increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on
the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.
    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the
seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal
and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,
linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled
through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through
the eight-lock canal.
    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs
this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal
1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive
member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.
    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.
Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on
the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.
    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about
2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said
it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'
demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.
    "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," Roman
Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.
    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator
to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two
sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on
the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.
    "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a
prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," Seaway
Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.
    "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the
St Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of the
Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major
Canadian shipping companies, said recently.
    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The
association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages
for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to
restructure crew dispatching.
    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs
(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and
freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985
was its worst year in two decades.
    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on
the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last
year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls
throughout the rest of the waterway.
    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and
about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.
    "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we
won't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.
    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers
in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this
season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,
Blair said.

<DATELINE>    COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chemlawn Corp and Ecolab Inc
said they signed a definitive merger agreement under which
Ecolab will buy all outstanding Chemlawn common stock for 36.50
dlrs a share in cash, for a total of about 370 mln dlrs.
    Under terms of the agreement, Chemlawn said it rescinded
its previously announced rights dividend plan.
    Chemlawn previously rejected a 27 dlr a share offer from
Waste Management Inc &lt;WMX>.
    Yesterday, the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste disposal company
said it was prepared to offer 33 dlrs a share, or about 330 mln
dlrs, for Chemlawn, a lawn-care company.
    Chemlawn had said last week that it was negotiating with
other possible suitors, which it did not identify.
    A Chemlawn spokesman said further details on the merger
would be issued later.
    Ecolab is a maker of commercial laundry detergent based in
St. Paul, Minn. For its first six months ended December 31, the
company earned 20.4 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, on sales of
421.8 mln dlrs.
    Officials at Waste Management could not be reached for
immediate comment.

<DATELINE>    HICKSVILLE, N.Y., March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Long Island Lighting Co said
it revised its preliminary 1986 net income to include a 16 mln
dlrs after tax provision for its investment in the Jamesport
Nuclear units.
    Due to the provision, it said its revised 1986 net income
was 316.7 mln dlrs or 2.13 dlrs per share after deducting for
preferred stock dividend requirements, which were not paid in
either 1986 or 1985.
    It had earlier reported 1986 income of 332.7 mln dlrs or
2.28 dlrs per share.
    LILCO also said its board authorized contracts for its 
corporate officers calling for payment of one year's salary,
and continuation of insurance and retirement benefits if the
company changes hands and these officers lose their jobs.
    LILCO said none of these contracts will result in
additional costs to its customers.
    Lilco said the downward revision in its 1986 earnings is a
reserve established to reflect a settlement agreement with the
staff of New York State's Public Service Commission respecting
the utility's spending on a nuclear power station planned for,
but never built at, Jamestown, N.Y.
    The company declined to detail the settlement, explaining
the settlement has not been approved by the commission. Lilco
was seeking to include costs totaling 118 mln dlrs for the
abandoned nuclear power plant project in its rate base, a
spokeswoman said.

<TITLE>WALL STREET SURVIVES TRIPLE EXPIRATIONS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 20 -  </DATELINE><BODY>The four-times-a-year "triple
witching hour" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has in
the past.
    Market averages finished sharply higher as stock index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks expired
simultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may be
retraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is getting
used to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity in
the final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchange
said the day went smoothly and efficiently.
    "This has been one of the few times that the consensus has
been right," said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch
and Co.
    He expects a "follow-through" Monday and Tuesday to the
advance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 points
for the day and 75 points for the entire week.
    Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved in
arbitrage activity involving index futures and options, said
the general trend of the market has been upward for months.
"Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with more
money," he said.
    He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accounts
prior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japanese
investors are apparently helping push stocks higher.
    Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc,
said reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end of
the fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.
    He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedged
with short positions in index futures rolled the expiring March
futures over into June contracts. But he added different
players with other goals also were active and there was no
simple explanation of the market's gyrations.
    For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the June
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15
minutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, the
contracted dipped to 297.50. "That could have been a wave of
selling from institutional people making a roll," he said.
    It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500
hit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. "It looks
like the market is going to continue to go higher," he said.
    "Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was a
strong day for stocks," said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co.
    Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by
"good solid buying interest" which will cushion any pullback.
    Other investors who were long futures and short stocks
bought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, said
Mark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against
"over-dramatizing" the day's activity, which said was more a
reflection of fundamental strength in the markets.
    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was
mostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options
and individual options expired. He said there could be a
decline early next week in the stock market.
    "It looked like it worked well today," said Howard Kramer,
asssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and
Exchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have to
be analyzed next week.
    He said there was relatively little commotion at the close,
with about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minute
compared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three months
earlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points in
the closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.
    Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility,
disclosure of "market-on-close" orders in 50 major stocks 30
minutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances of
modest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening out
volatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of the
imbalance.
    The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47
stocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, and
no significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tightened
a rule governing what type of market on close orders can be
accepted in the final half hour.

<TITLE>CANADA'S CLARK SEES TRADE AS MOST URGENT PROBLEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Dean Lokken, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Trade is the most urgent problem
facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to
reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark,
Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.
    Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for
more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.
    "The most urgent problem now is the trade question because
that has to be decided within the next 10 months," Clark told
the Commonwealth Club of California. "We have a fast track
authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of
whatever the negotiators achieve."
    Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial
agreement must be reached by late September or early October.
    He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain,
and defense as the second and third most important bilateral
issues facing Ottawa and Washington.
    On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek
2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain
problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in
advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs
group, Clark said that the two countries must find better
mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.
    "This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on
corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were
quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place
now are not working adequately in either of our interests," he
said.
    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules
on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he
said.
    "There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to
secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to
move their head offices out of our country into your country
because you have national procurement requirements," he said.
    In turn, he added, the United States would like to change
some of the procurement requirements that exist at the
provincial government level in Canada.
    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.
    "What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in
the first instance, to propose, and then governments and
congresses will have judge," he said.
    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States
has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to
its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.
"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year
than you bought from Canada," he said. REUTER

<TITLE>ALBERTA BUDGET SETS TAX INCREASE, LOWER DEFICIT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    EDMONTON, Alberta, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Alberta provincial
government will increase its general corporate tax rate on
April 1 to 15 pct from 11 pct under its 1987-88 budget
announced today, provincial treasurer Dick Johnston said.
    The budget forecasts the 1987-88 provincial deficit to be
1.90 billion dlrs, compared to a forecast deficit of 3.30
billion dlrs for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, Johnston
said.
    The budget forecasts fiscal 1988 revenues of 8.63 billion
dlrs and expenditures of 10.42 billion dlrs, Johnston said.
    The provincial budget raises combined personal and
corporate income taxes by about 20 pct, Johnston said.
    Johnston told a news conference taxes were increased after
revenues from oil and gas taxes fell by 64 pct last year and
are not expected to increase sharply in the short term.
    The provincial government expects resource tax revenues for
fiscal 1987 to fall to 1.30 billion dlrs from a previously
estimated 2.20 billion dlrs, compared to 3.60 billion dlrs
collected in fiscal 1986 before the collapse in oil prices.
    Johnston told reporters he needed to raise taxes in order
to begin moving towards a balanced budget in 1990-91.
    Johnston said the personal income tax increase takes three
forms. The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from
43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.
    The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pct
surtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000
dlrs, he said.
    In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax on
all individuals with taxable income.
    Johnston said overall government spending of 10.42 billion
dlrs represents a cut of 4.4 pct, but various grants and tax
credits for agriculture and energy industries will remain.

an equal-sized offering of third priority certificates due 1999
was given an 11-3/8 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The second two tranches of the equipment-backed deal are
non-callable for five years, Drexel said.
    Continental's 10-year notes were assigned an 11-1/2 pct
coupon and priced at par. They are non-callable for five years.
Texas Air has guaranteed the scheduled payments of interest and
principal for the senior notes.
    The securities are rated B-2 by Moody's and B by Standard

co-managed the issues. Proceeds, estimated at 486 mln dlrs,
will be used to repay about 254 mln dlrs of bank debt, with the
remainder added to working capital, Continental said.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>World Bank President Barber Conable
said he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt
interest payments is temporary.
    Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown
on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the
attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan
designed to reform its economy.
    "I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their
creditors, but they must come up with a plan that will persuade
people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a
course that will result in some growth."
    Turning to Japan, Conable said the role of that country has
been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue
to do so.
    He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr
pledge to the International Development Association, an
indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in
line with its economic position.
    Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union
was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. He said they would have to get convertible currency
and open their books and the Soviets "don't usually do that."

<TITLE>NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By NAILENE CHOU-WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Higher crude oil prices will raise
demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost
to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.
    The analysts said that these efforts will be most
successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large
and growing energy requirements.
    "Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of
oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual
fuel industry last year," Michael Smolinski, an energy
economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.
    An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went
into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last
year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. 
    Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national
average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected
2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,
Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American
Gas Association said.
    The average delivered prices at the end of January were
2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.
    "We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic
feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and
third quarter (1987)," he said.
    In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be
an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,
Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.
in New York noted.
    Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North
American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and
less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this
spring freeing gas for spot sales.
    These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears
that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices
significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last
year.
    AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,
much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production
quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which
permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.
    Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus
was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986
to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not
go away until 1990.
    Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would
persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain
consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast
U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.

<TITLE>U.S. SENATORS SAY SANCTIONS LIKELY ON MICROCHIPS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jacqueline Frank, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The United States will likely impose
sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said
today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige.
    Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision
would be taken until a final determination is made on whether
Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said
they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.
    President Reagan's trade policy advisory group, of which
Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.
    "I am confident we will see action taken," Sen. John McCain,
an Arizona Republican, told reporters.
    "I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than
sanctions," Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.
    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor
industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department
officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September
1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United
States and other countries.
    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through
tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for
continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100
mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.
    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.
Pete Wilson told reporters, "The clear import of what he said is
that there will be."
    "Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions
must be applied," for past violations of the agreement, the
California Republican said.
    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips
which are used in high technology products ranging from radios
to defence missile guidance systems.
    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told
them the administration had not made a final determination that
Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below
the cost of production in the United States or other countries.
    But McClure said senators told him, "There is no doubt
dumping is going on," based on evidence such as invoices of
purchases of the Japanese products.
    The two countries signed a pact last September in which
Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United
States and other countries below production costs and to allow
the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.
    In return, the United States waived its right to impose
import duties on the Japanese microchips.
    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact
and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to
save the pact.
    Japan has frequently been the target of congressional
discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade
deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United
States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.
    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution
calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact
since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House
next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.

committee completed another round of debt rescheduling talks 
and will meet again on Saturday, a senior banker said.
    Although today's negotiations did not produce a final
agreement, the decision to meet at the weekend appears to be a
signal that the two sides are making progress.
    The Philippines seeks to restructure 9.4 billion dlr of its
27.2 billion dlr foreign debt. The interest rate to be charged
on the debt and Manila's proposal to pay interest partly with
investment notes instead of cash have been the main sticking
points in the talks.

<TITLE>DALLAS-BASED THRIFT CLOSED BY REGULATORS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board
said Dallas-based Vernon Savings and Loan Association, the 15th
largest thrift in Texas, was closed by state authorities and
its assets, deposits and liabilities were transfered to a new
federally chartered association.
    Vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine offices
in Texas and Oklahoma, was closed after state regulators
concluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.
    The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, who
bought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs in
assets.
    The bank board said growth was accomplished largely through
the purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbo
certificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total deposits
at the end of 1986.
    The bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfolio
was nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.
    It said Vernon also paid excessive salaries and dividends
to officers and directors and bought a beach house and five
airplances for the use of thrift executives and stockholders.
    The bank board ousted the thrift's officers and directors
and hired another Texas association to run it.
    The bank board also said it closed First Federal of
Maryland, a federal savings association that had 115.2 mln dlrs
in assets. It said its 118 mln dlrs in insured deposits were
transferred to Columbia First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Washington, D.C.
    The bank board said First Federal had engaged in unsound
loan underwriting practices and many of the loans are now
deliquent. The institution experienced heavy and continuing
losses and became insolvent, the bank board said.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - BOLIVIA</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Paul Iredale, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LA PAZ, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bolivia, once Latin America's most
delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International
Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program
has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.
    A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz
shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.
    He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln
dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this
month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory
financing facility and a structural adjustment facility.
    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,
Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the
next 12 months.
    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,
opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris
Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of
Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.
    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the
negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be
finalised, had been extremely successful.
    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule
Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and
had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.
    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.
    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in
disbursements this year from lender countries and international
agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put
the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.
    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are
around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor
Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the
capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had
changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net
inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz
estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited
inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were
losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on
the black market at up to 16 times its official rate.
    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-
related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off
thousands of workers in state corporations.
    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past
six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government 
expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct
contraction over the last six years.
    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its
debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest
has not been paid since March, 1984.
    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would
make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at
the price it trades on the international secondary market -- 
10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank
steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider
the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the
country's creditor banks will take up the offer.
    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to
buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the
deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans
to the country.
    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a
scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated
in Chile for the past two years.
    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for
debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to
privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve
as a basis for such a scheme.
    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove
attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the
government realises that it will have to attract a large amount
of new capital in order to grow.
    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters
that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new
investment over the next 10 to 12 years.
    The government realises that in order to remain viable,
Bolivia will need to develop new exports.
    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of
Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,
and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant
supply in the region.
