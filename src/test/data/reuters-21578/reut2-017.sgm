<TITLE>SORO GROUP TO LIMIT FAIRCHILD &lt;FEN> STOCK BUYS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>Quantum Fund N.V., a Netherlands
Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros
is investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit further
purchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.
    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
Quantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.
    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could "impair" the government security clearances Fairchild
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not
make "significant additional purchases" of its common or
preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.
    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.
    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
Fairchild at this time.
    The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     Fairchild's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be
held tomorrow.

first quarter foreign exchange trading income rose to 82.8 mln
dlrs from 20.9 mln dlrs in the first qtr of 1986, offsetting
the bank's 7.4 mln dlr loss incurred from placing 540 mln dlrs
of Brazilian loans on a non-accrual status.
    Earlier, the bank reported that first quarter net income
increased to 124.2 mln dlrs, or 1.77 dlrs a share, from 115.9
mln dlrs, or 1.64 dlrs a share, a year ago.
    Bankers Trust chairman Alfred Brittain III said increased
non-interest income, a lower provision for loan-losses and
increased net interest income also helped first quarter net.
   
    Bankers Trust previously announced that the 540 mln dlrs in
non-accruable Brazilian loans would cut its first quarter
earnings by 7.4 mln dlrs, and could slice about 30 mln dlrs
from the full year's net.
    Bankers Trust said non-interest income in the first quarter
equaled 275.4 mln dlrs, up 37.1 mln dlrs from a year ago.
    Loan losses fell in the quarter to 22 mln dlrs, versus 40
mln dlrs a year ago while taxable net interest income remained
flat at 266 mln dlrs, the bank said.

uncertainty. The action will result in higher capital rates and
higher rates for customers, he said.
    He said the Pennsylvania Utility commission indicated in
its most recent rate case decision that even if newly
constructed Perry No. 1 nuclear plant was in commercial
operation, shareholders would be denied a return on their
investment in the plant. Von Schack called on shareholders to
join it and certain legislators' efforts to create a
partnership to fight these issues and resolve these problems.

<TITLE>CREATIVE MONETARY POLICY TO SPUR KUWAITI ECONOMY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    KUWAIT, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last
year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary
policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said.
    "There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money
in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in
interest bearing investments which have no direct productive
outlet," one banker said.
    Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market
rate and abandoned another which had been used since February
1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs.
    The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at
which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the
inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates.
    The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of
interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor
Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive
the economy.
    One banker said "There is growing flexibility, creativity,
in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to
diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector."
    For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest
rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a
favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the
past, banking sources said.
    Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran-
Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the
prospect of any significant capital flight.
    The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank
and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger
now than for several years.
    Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second
thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching
funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said.
    "There is a distinct exchange rate risk," they added.
    Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind
the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18
pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping in the Gulf.
    The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against
a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact
make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar.
    Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond
0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting
funds into the U.S. Currency. "They may ask:When will the dollar
be so cheap again?" one said.
    And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below
those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a
delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility.
    Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy
is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment
and strengthen the backbone of the economy.
    They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and
allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct
contraction the previous year.
    Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock
market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees
to make it cheaper for investors to trade.

<TITLE>SENATE PREPARING FOR NEW U.S. BUDGET BATTLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Michael Posner, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>Congress returned from its Easter
recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises
to be a partisan dispute.
    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan
and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the
Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is
taking on new prominence because of current trade woes.
    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge
deficits are said to be at the root of related international
trade friction currently worrying financiers.
    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock
exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United
States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade
war between the two trading giants for the first time since
World War II.
    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is
refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the
resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions
and small computers.
    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither
side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.
    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to
the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to
grow without repercussions.
    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by
foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they
withdraw this support the result can only be further problems,
including higher interest rates for Americans.
    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the
showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar
spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,
was trounced badly in the House on April 9.
    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the
House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171
billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through
defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs
in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up
its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be
passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.
    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,
which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's
Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate
Budget Committee for full Senate consideration.
    A key Senate Budget Committee source told Reuters he
believes this very unusual unanimous opposition was by design
among congressional Republicans, perhaps with the tacit
approval of the White House.
    "Republicans want Democrats to take the heat for any tax
hikes and defense cuts," he said.
    In the coming weeks, the source said, Democrats will press
for a bipartisan budget and seek a negotiated budget with
Reagan -- who already is opposed to the idea. But "it is not
clear how the Republicans will act," he added.
    He said Republicans may propose their own plan for lower
taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after
Reagan's budget was clobbered in an early vote in the House.
     When Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he inherited
what was labelled a huge deficit from Jimmy Carter that wound
up to be nearly 79 billion dlrs that year.
    Despite Reagan's promise to balance the budget by 1983,
critics note that his administration's record of accumulated
debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or 1,100 billion
dlrs.
    That is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and
many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused
the worst U.S. trade deficit ever.
     Last year the United States bought goods from the world
worth 169.8 billion dlrs more than what it sold, including
purchases of 58.6 billion dlrs in Japanese goods.
    While Congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one
front through a get-tough trade bill promising retaliatory
measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far
against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress.
    Congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the
deficit on a downward path from its record high of 220.7
billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal 1986, which ended Sept. 30.
    Because of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law
enacted in late 1985, there has been pressure on Congress to do
more than talk about deficits.
    That law, named after Republican Senators Phil Gramm of
Texas, Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, calls for a balanced budget by 1991
through a series of set deficit targets that Congress must meet.
    The law has been followed, even though an enforcement
mechanism to mandate automatic across-the-board cuts if
Congress misses its goal was stricken by the Supreme Court.
    The legislators have followed the targets -- on paper. But
in reality, the goal has actually been missed. For example,
Congress last year approved legislation to meet the 1987 target
of a 144 billion dlr deficit. But even after approving the
numbers, the deficit for 1987 is estimated at over 170 billion
dlrs -- far off the target.
    This year the target is 108 billion dlrs and that goal is
expected to be missed widely.

<TITLE>SPAIN MAINTAINS FIVE PCT INFLATION TARGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MADRID, April 21 - </DATELINE><BODY>Spanish Secretary of State for the
economy Guillermo de la Dehesa said the government maintained
its five pct inflation target for this year although a 0.6 pct
increase in March pushed the rise in the year on year consumer
price index to 6.3 pct.
    De la Dehesa said the March rise, announced today by the
National Statistics Institute, was not entirely satisfactory
but acceptable.
    The year on year rate at the end of February was six pct.
Prices rose 8.3 pct last year.
    The March rise included a 0.05 pct increase correcting an
error in last January's consumer price index. Economists had
earlier said the error could have been as high as 0.2 pct.
    De la Dehesa said seasonal increases in food prices pushed
the index up in March and he expected the rate to be lower in
April.
    The Communist-led Workers Commissions union said the March
price rise showed inflation was going up again and the
government looked increasingly unlikely to meet its five pct
target.
    The Workers Commissions said the inflation trend fuelled
unions's claims to wage increases beyond the government's
recomendation to limit wage rises at around five pct.
    Spain is being affected by a two-month-old wave of strikes
for wage rises. Government officials note wage settlements so
far this year have yielded average increases upwards of six
pct, while unions say the figure is higher then seven pct.

Commission reminded securities dealers that its mark-up
disclosure requirements also applies to transactions on
zero-coupon securities.
    Dealers and brokers are required by U.S. securities law to
disclose their mark-ups if they are excessive, the SEC said in
a public notice.
    Further, excessive mark-ups on securities transactions,
whether disclosed or not, violate the rules of the national
Association of Securities Dealers Inc and Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, it said.
    In a separate action, the SEC filed a friend-of-the-court
brief in a private civil case involving a complaint against
Merrill Lynch over excessive mark-ups on zero-coupon bonds. The
case is being appealed to the U.S. Appeals Court.
    The lower court dismissed the complaint, finding antifraud
provisions of securities laws do not prohibit undisclosed
excessive mark-ups on securities transactions.
    The SEC is urging the appeals court to reverse the
decision, citing its nearly 50 year-old position that
undisclosed excessive mark-ups by securities dealers violate
the general antifraud provisions of securities laws.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Special Japanese envoy Shintaro Abe
said in a brief interview with Reuters that the feeling in the
U.S. congress is "very severe" against Japan.
    However, Abe said he believed that neither Congress nor the
Reagan administration wants to undermine relations with Japan.
    He said the Reagan administration showed "relative
understanding" of how Japan is trying to alleviate its U.S.
trade imbalance. Abe said he was convinced "Congress and the
administration had the same view that the relationship between
Tokyo and Washington should not be undermined."

<TITLE>FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. banking data released today are
too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

<DATELINE>     SAN JOSE, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A large group of "other milds"
coffee-growing nations will hold talks in Guatemala next month
to map their strategy for next September's meeting of the
International Coffee Organisation (ICO).
    Mario Fernandez, executive director of the Costa Rican
coffee institute, said delegates from Mexico, the Dominican
Republic, Peru, Ecuador, India, Papua New Guinea and five
central american nations will participate in the two-day
strategy session beginning May 4.
    The main topic will be reform of what many producing
countries perceive as the ICO's unfair distribution of export
quotas, Fernandez said.
    He said Costa Rica would press for quotas "based on the
real production and export potential of each country in the
past few years" and to distribute quotas based on "historic"
production levels rather than recent harvests and crop
estimates.

<TITLE>US STUDY DISCUSSES DROPPED COMSAT-CONTEL MERGER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>A congressional study today said the
proposed, but now apparently abandoned, merger of the
Communications Satellite Corp &lt;CQ> and Contel Corp &lt;CTC>
would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the
law setting up COMSAT.
    Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel
announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.
    The study by the non partisan Congressional Research
Service (CRS) said "the proposed merger appears to comply,
technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may
nevertheless violate the spirit of the law."
    Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a
corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed
with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an
application for merger. Several firms had protested the
proposed merger.
    In an analysis of the law, the research service issued
several critical comments about the structure of the new firm
and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT
would have broken the spirit of the law setting up
COMSAT.COMSAT is the U.S. arm of Intelstat, the international
satellite communications firm.

    The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister

    Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to step

expire at the end of October.
    The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget
before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. so that he could
tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to
boost the sagging economy and imports.

1.5 pct in March and 11.3 pct in the 12 months to March, the
Reserve Bank said.
    This compared with a revised rise of 0.5 pct in February
and 11.1 pct in the year to end-February.
    The Reserve Bank said the M-3 data for March was affected
by the start of the operations of &lt;National Mutual Royal
Savings Bank Ltd>, which has resulted in the transfer of
deposits (equivalent to around 1.5 pct of m-3) from the United
Permanent Building Society to National Mutual Royal Savings
Bank Ltd.
    The Reserve Bank said M-3 money supply in March was 110.77
billion Australian dlrs compared with a revised 109.11 billion
in February and 99.48 billion in March, 1986.
    M-3 is deposits of the private sector held by trading and
savings banks plus holdings of notes and coins.

<TITLE>JAPANESE PARLIAMENT PASSES 1987 BUDGET</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Parliament's Lower House passed the 1987
budget shortly before midnight local time, official
parliamentary sources said.
    The move followed agreement by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party to a proposal that could kill its plan to
introduce a controversial sales tax, political analysts said.
The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax, they said.
    Some analysts said Nakasone may be forced to step down
after the June summit of heads of major industrial democracies
and before his one-year term is due to expire at end-October.
    Under the compromise agreed by the LDP and opposition
parties, Lower House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara will take charge of
the sales tax bill, appoint a ruling/opposition party council
to debate it and allow opposition leaders to review the present
tax system, analysts said.
    Hara also verbally agreed to scrap the sales tax plan
entirely if the joint council fails to reach agreement on how
to handle the tax.
    The opposition parties, who have been vociferously
attacking the sales tax plan for months, hailed the decision as
a great victory.
    The opposition parties had already delayed passage of the
budget for three weeks after the April 1 start of the fiscal
year by intermittent parliamentary boycotts.
    Although the LDP had more than enough votes to ram the
budget through parliament, it had been reluctant to do so for
fear of a backlash of public opinion, especially after its
setback in recent local elections due to the sales tax issue.
    The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget
before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. So that he could
tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to
boost the sagging economy and imports.
    According to Kyodo News Service, Nakasone told reporters he
did not think the sales tax was dead.
    If the sales tax is dropped, it could prove a major boost
to the economy because it would increase the government budget
deficit, economists said.
    The sales tax was originally scheduled to be introduced
next January to help offset the loss of government revenues
stemming from a cut in income and corporate taxes due to go
into effect this month.

<TITLE>JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support
the dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.
    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday
intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
curbing capital outflows.
    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
not that good, he said.
    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring
by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said it
was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.

<TITLE>STANDARD OIL SAYS BP EXTENDS TENDER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> said in a brief
announcement issued after a meeting of its board of directors
that British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP.L> (BP) has extended its 70
dlr per share tender offer until midnight May 4.
    The offer for the 45 pct of Standard shares not owned by BP
had been due to expire midnight April 28.
    Standard Oil said discussions with BP concerning the tender
were continuing but provided no further details.
    "So long as those discussions continue, no recommendation
will be made to Standard Oil shareholders regarding the offer,"
Standard said.
    Standard directors met at the company's Cleveland
headquarters on Thursday in a regularly scheduled meeting. The
spokesman was unable to say if the meeting would continue on
Friday.
    A committee of independent directors previously obtained an
opinion from First Boston Corp that the Standard shares were
worth 85 dlrs each, 15 dlrs more than the BP offer.

<TITLE>JAPAN AGENCY URGES WATCH ON YEN RISE EFFECTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan should look out for possible
effects of the yen's recent sharp rise on Japan's economy as
growth remains slow, the government's Economic Planning Agency
said in a monthly report submitted to cabinet ministers.
    EPA officials told reporters the underlying trend of the
economy is firm but growth is slow due to sluggish exports.
    Customs-cleared exports by volume fell 4.9 pct
month-on-month in February after a 2.8 pct fall in March.
    The government must take adequate economic measures to
expand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid to
ensure sustained econonic growth, the report said.
    The report made a special reference to the yen's renewed
rise and its effect on the economy, the officials said, adding
the agency's judgement of current economic conditions has not
changed since last month.
    The EPA said last month Japan's economy is beginning to
show signs of bottoming out, conditional upon exchange rates.
    The dollar fell below 139 yen in early trading today - a
post-war low.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan does not intend to ease
credit policy further, bank officials told Reuters.
    They were responding to rumours in the Japanese bond market
that the central bank was planning to cut its 2.5 pct discount
rate soon, possibly before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
leaves for Washington on April 29.
    Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka,
western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the
Asian Development Bank, making a rate cut announcement early
next week a virtual impossibility, they said. April 29 is a

<TITLE>ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOGOTA, April 23 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.
    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared
with what we are going to earn."
    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

<TITLE>SWISS COMMITTED TO JOINT CURRENCY INTERVENTION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BERNE, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Swiss National Bank will continue to
take part in concerted intervention on currency markets as
necessary, president Pierre Languetin told the bank's annual
meeting.
    He said the dollar had on occasion hit highs or lows which
bore no relation to economic fundamentals and cooperation
between all monetary authorities was necessary to prevent it
breaching thresholds that would damage everyone.
    "We are resolved -- as we have done in the past -- to take
part in concerted intervention to the extent that this is
possible and desirable," Languetin said.
    Languetin said Switzerland had noted with satisfaction the
six nation Paris accord on currency stabilisation measures in
February, adding that it had anchored the principle of
strengthened international cooperation.
    He said measures such as recent concerted intervention were
useful in the short term.
    But he added, "The (Paris) Louvre accord can produce no
lasting effects without a correction of the fundamental
imbalances, without a reduction of the American budget deficit
and without stronger growth in Europe and Japan."
    Languetin said certain changes would probably be necessary
in the "too expansive" monetary policy of the United States,
adding that there was a prevailing view that U.S. Money supply
was expanding too strongly.
    "If this should last long the dollar could only be
stabilised at the cost of a substantial easing in monetary
policy on the part of the other central banks, which would in
turn create the basis for a new wave of world-wide inflation,"
he said. One positive factor was that monetary authorities in
the most important countries had not relinquished their
anti-inflation policies.

<TITLE>JAPANESE BUYERS ACCEPT CUBA SUGAR DELAY - TRADERS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, April 24 - </DATELINE><BODY>Several Japanese buyers have accepted
postponement of between 150,000 and 200,000 tonnes of Cuban raw
sugar scheduled for delivery in calendar 1987 until next year
following a request from Cuba, trade sources said.
    Cuba had sought delays for some 300,000 tonnes of
deliveries, they said. It made a similar request in January
when Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200,000 tonnes of
sugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988.
    Some buyers rejected the Cuban request because they have
already sold the sugar on to refiners, they added.
    Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some
950,000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment.
    But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likely
to total only some 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes this year, against
576,990 in 1986, reflecting both the postponements and sales
earlier this year by Japanese traders of an estimated 150,000
tonnes of Cuban sugar to the USSR for 1987 shipment, they said.
    They estimated Japan's total sugar imports this year at 1.8
mln tonnes, against 1.81 mln in 1986, of which Australia is
expected to supply 550,000, against 470,000, South Africa
350,000, against 331,866, and Thailand 400,000, after 390,776.
