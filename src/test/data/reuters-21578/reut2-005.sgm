    He told Reuters the decision not to put any limit responded
to "new factors" which have emerged from recent International

consumers failed to agree on a re-introduction of export quotas.

<TITLE>USDA REPORTS 10.572 MLN ACRES IN CONSERVATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Agriculture Department has
accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into
the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.
    In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted
bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.
    The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to
90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
    Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be
ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with
permanent vegetative cover.
    Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"
rental payment that was offered by USDA.
    The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity
certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS
program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based
accepted into the reserve.
    The state showing the biggest enrollment in the
conservation program during this signup was Texas with
approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln
acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and
Kansas with 842,000 acres.
    Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with
646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska
with 554,000 acres.
    In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000
acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled.
    Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program
totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up
to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs.

<TITLE>BRAZIL DEBT POSES THORNY ISSUE FOR U.S. BANKS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>CitiCorp &lt;CCI> appears to be digging
in its heels for tough negotiations over the billions of
dollars in loans that Brazil owes to money center banks, Wall
Street analysts said.
    "I view it as pre-negotiation posturing," said analyst
Carole Berger of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc, referring to both
Brazil and Citicorp. Brazil recently stopped paying interest on
its commercial bank debt. Today, CitiCorp said its first
quarter income would be reduced by 50 mln dlrs after tax if it
lists the loans as non-performing status.
    Citicorp filed an 8-K form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, indicating a material change in its financial
situation. "Citicorp is saying you can't scare us with threats,
we'll make your loans non-performing right now," Berger said.
    The loans have to be treated as non-performing after 90
days without a payment. CitiCorp said only that the situation
will be reviewed at the end of the current quarter.
    Berger asserted that Brazil is doing its own politicking by
talking to U.S. regulators and trying to drive a wedge between
U.S. and European banks.
    Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Merrill Lynch and Co said it is
unlikely the situation will be resolved until the second half
of this year.
    "Ultimately the Brazilians are going to have to pay up on
all the interest they owe," Cohn said. "The real issue is the
rescheduling of debt terms.
    Another question is whether or not the International
Monetary Fund can help Brazil with a new austerity program.
    Stocks of money center banks were mostly down fractions in
late dealings. One trader most stocks in the group bounced off
their lows by midday as investors took the news in stride.
    Cohn said the bank stocks may be risky until numbers on
non-performing loans are reported for each bank. But he said
investors looking ahead six to 12 months might want to buy at
present levels for the "tremendous fundamental values" in the
group.
    Analyst Robert Gordon of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC) has the greatest exposure to
Brazilian loans of any New York bank, in terms of percentage of
earnings. He said his only two recommendations currently among
New York banks are J.P. Morgan and Co &lt;JPM> and Bankers Trust
Co &lt;BT> which happen to have the least exposure.
    Gordon said his positive opinion on J.P. Morgan and Bankers
Trust was not merely a response to the fact that the two have
lower exposure to Brazilian loans than other banks. 
    In fact he said there's a chance those banks could get more
involved in the future. He noted that Morgan has already set up
a brokerage subsidiary to deal in loans to less developed
countries.
    "I don't see any reason to change full year earnings
estimates, said Frederick Meinke, analyst at E.F. Hutton Co. He
thinks the confrontation with Brazil could end in a replay of a
situation that occurred with Argentina in 1984 and 1985.
    Meinke noted that in the case of Argentina the loans became
non-accruing for a couple of quarters but then when the banks
came to an agreement with Argentina all the back interest was
paid. "What it did was distort the quarterly earnings pattern,"
he said.
    He said in the case of Brazil write-offs of loans is a
worst-case outcome which is highly unlikely. He noted that
Brazil is a country with a diversified economy, going through
some economic upheaval after the transition from a military to
a civilian government.
    "The countries of Latin America have too much debt relative
to their ability to service it," said John Mason of
Interstate Securities. "We've been fiddling around with these
problems for five years and the hour is growing late."
    He said up to now the banks have reduced their spreads, cut
interest rates internally and extended maturities and none of
these measures has been enough. He expects re-classification of
as much as a third of the loans as non-accruing and he sees
partial write downs of some loans.
    Nevertheless Mason thinks the money center bank stocks 
could be poised for a short term rally.
    A spokesman at First Chicago Corp &lt;FNB> said it is
premature to put Brazil's loans on a cash basis. "It is our
expectation that economic development will allow Brazil to meet
its debt," a spokesman said.
    Bankers Trust in New York said it would be premature to
make a decision. Several other banks queried by Reuters said
much the same thing.
    A spokesman at Manufacturers Hanover noted that of 2.3
billion dlrs in loan exposure to Brazil only 1.3 billion is
subject to Brazil's unilateral moratorium on repayment of
interest.

<TITLE>ROCKWELL &lt;ROK> TO REPURCHASE MORE COMMON SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PITTSBURGH, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Rockwell International Corp said its
board has authorized extension of the company's 500 mln dlr
stock repurchase program by an additional 500 mln dlrs.
    Since the beginning of the present repurchase program in
March 1986, Rockwell said, it has bought 10.4 mln shares for
461 mln dlrs. At present prices, it said, the program would
reduce the presently outstanding 140 mln common shares by about
seven pct. Since November 1983, the company has repurchased
18.1 mln shares for 672 mln dlrs, it said.
    Rockwell said the stock will be repurchased through open
market and private transactions.
    Rockwell said the repurchased shares will be available for
potential acquisitions, stock options, employee benefit
programs, conversion of convertible securities and other
purposes.
    The company said, "We continue to view our repurchase
program as an integral part of our long term goal of improving
shareholder values."
    Rockwell said the program "complements our aggressive
program of support for the growth plans of our businesses with
capital investments, product and research development
resources, and acquisitions in support of our core businesses."

<DATELINE>    VAIL, Colo., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Storage Technology Corp said it is
holding dicussions with the Internal Revenue Service that could
end their dispute over the amount of back taxes owed by the
company.
    "We are currently pursuing discussions with the IRS that
could lead to a final solution," Stephen G. Jerritts, president
and chief operating officer said. "Simultaneously, we are
taking all necessary actions to try to expedite the court
appeal process, resolve these issues and allow final court
approval of the plan of reorganization, by our target date of
June 30, 1987," he said.
    Last year, Storage Technology's bankruptcy court ruled that
the company owed about 25 mln dlrs in taxes, an amount much
lower than the IRS is seeking.
    The IRS has appealed the court's decision.
    Jerritts also said his company and &lt;Siemens AG> of West
Germany extended an agreement under which Storage Technology
distributes a laser printer made by Siemens.

<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Retail sales of new cars by U.S.
automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels
since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp down 9.3
pct while Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp both had gains.
    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since
the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the
world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several
times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various
plants.
    Consumer incentives apparently had some success, analysts
said, as the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved
to 7.5 mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The
eight domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.

<TITLE>GOLDMAN SACHS GIVEN BOGUS EXXON BONDS IN TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Goldman Sachs International Corp
received forged bonds of a unit of Exxon Corp &lt;XON> in a trade,
a spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Co Inc said in a telephone
conversation from New York.
    He said the transaction left Goldman Sachs International
with an exposure of about 2.2 mln dlrs but that it had
insurance to cover the loss.
    The spokesman was responding to an enquiry about an item in
the London "Standard" newspaper, which said Goldman Sachs "is
feared to be the victim of a new multi-million pound City
scandal."
    The newspaper also said, "The firm (Goldman Sachs) is
believed to be the paying agent for some 900 bonds issued in
the name of oil giant Exxon which were deposited at banks in
Brussels and have now been found to be forgeries."
    The spokesman said that the bonds were delivered to the
firm by a man working on behalf of a third party. He said it
wasn't until the bonds were cleared through Euro-clear (a major
clearing house for the eurobond market) that it was discovered
they were forgeries.
    The spokesman also said he believed that the intermediary
had been apprehended by police. However, a spokesman for the
City of London police said he was unaware of such an arrest and
could neither confirm nor deny it.
    Last Friday, Exxon Corp said forgeries of a 20-year zero
coupon euronote issued by its Exxon Capital Corp subsidiary
have been discovered in the European market. It also said
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co was the fiscal agent and paying agent
and that Morgan, Euro-clear and Cedel (another major clearing
system) and police in London and Brussels were investigating
the case.

its first offering of Euro-commercial paper in the
international market on Monday, EdF chief financial officer
Daniel Lallier said in a telephone call from Paris.
    The program was announced in late January and dealers
expect the company will be pushing to maintain its ability to
obtain some of the finest terms available in the international
markets.
    Lallier did not say how much would be offered, although he
has noted that EDF would be cautious because it believes the
market is still in its infancy. In January he said EdF may not
issue more than 300 to 500 mln dlrs of paper this year.
    EdF plans to oversee the program itself, with Goldman Sachs
International Corp, Morgan Guaranty Ltd and Salomon Brothers
International Ltd acting as dealers for the general program,
which will be aimed at institutional and retail investors.
    Union Bank of Switzerland will act as dealer for a specific
program, which is aimed at smaller retail investors.

<TITLE>CBT TRADERS SAY U.S. CONSERVATION SIGNUP NEUTRAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable
farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of
10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain
and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said.
    Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus
rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin
new crop futures, they said.
    New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a
large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor
yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest
decrease in final production figures, since farmers will
concentrate on high yielding land.
    Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda
accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental
payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
    Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres.

<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea said negotiations with creditor banks on Argentina's
30 billion dlr private sector foreign debt were difficult.
    "There is considerable divergence with the banks. We must
try to get them to lower the spreads," Machinea told Reuter.
    He said negotiations with the steering committee for the
country's creditor banks in New York would not end next week.
    Machinea leaves for New York tomorrow with Treasury
Secretary Mario Brodersohn to complete Argentina's team at
negotiations with the steering committee for a 2.15 biilion dlr
loan to see the country through 1987.
    Machinea said Argentina had World Bank support. He said he
and Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille had discussed Argentina's
loan request with World Bank Vice-President David Knox, who is
currently in Buenos Aires.
    Argentina is aiming at four pct growth in 1987 and has said
this target is not negotiable. It has indicated that it would
not put payment of interest due on its foreign debt ahead of
its growth target if the loan was not granted.
    The United States and 12 other industrial nations granted
Argentina a 500 mln dlr bridge which was received this week.
    Talks on the 2.15 billion dlr lona began in January.

<TITLE>UNION CARBIDE &lt;UK> DEBT UPGRADED BY S/P</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
upgraded 1.2 billion dlrs of debt of Union Carbide Corp and its
affiliate, DCS Capital Corp.
    Raised were the pair's senior debt to BB-plus from
BB-minus. Union Carbide's subordinated debt was upgraded to
BB-minus from B.
    S and P said the action reflected several positive factors
which emerged over the past year, including a better balance of
supply and demand in the chemical industry. Union Carbide has
also benefitted from the turnaround in foreign exchange rates
and lower feedstock costs, the agency noted.
    Standard and Poor's said the company's asset sales, and
subsequent use of the proceeds for debt reduction, exceeded the
corporate plan of a year ago.
    The rating agency also pointed out that Union Carbide's
successful refinancing of more than 2.5 billion dlrs of
long-term debt has resulted in a substantially lower interest
burden.

<TITLE>U.S. EARLY MARCH CAR SALES OFF 2.2 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Richard Walker, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    DETROIT, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Retail sales of new cars by U.S.
automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels
since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> down
9.3 pct.
    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both had gains.
    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since
the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the
world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several
times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various
plants.
    Relatively weaker sales by all of the Detroit Big Three
carmakers have compelled the companies to offer a string of
sales incentives including cash rebates and below-market
interest loans in an effort to reignite the market.
    Incentives apparently had some success, analysts said, as
the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved to 7.5
mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The eight
domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.
    GM said its sales of domestic-built cars in the March 1-10
period declined to 97,487 from 104,952 a year ago while truck
sales rose 14.4 pct to 40,131 from 35,081. There were eight
selling days in each period.
    Despite the lower car sales, the giant automaker had a
bright spot as its Chevrolet division, which is launching a
national sales campaign this month for its new Corsica and
Beretta compact cars, was up almost 21 pct when only
domestic-built cars were counted. GM's Buick division was also
up, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac was
off 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.
    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6
pct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said was
partly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.
    Meanwhile, Ford said its car sales rose 5.9 pct to 50,407
compared with 47,592 a year ago while truck sales gained by
12.6 pct to 35,814 from 31,811.
    Number three Chrysler's car sales gained to 0.4 pct to
25,286 from 25,191 while its truck sales gained 15 pct to
15,565 from 13,585. The truck sales were a record for the
period, the company said.
    Among the smaller makers, Honda &lt;HMC> said domestic car
sales rose 16 pct to 4,394 from 3,786 and Volkswagen of America
rose 4.9 pct to 849 from 809.
    American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> fell 57 pct to 760 from 1,780
for cars but rose 18 pct in jeep sales to 4,500 from 3,800.
    Nissan &lt;NSANY> car sales rose 19.1 pct to 2,137 from 1,794
and gained 3.6 pct on trucks to 1,686 from 1,628. Toyota
&lt;TOYOY> said it sold 500 U.S.-built cars compared with none a
year ago.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>Expiration dates on upland cotton
certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are
being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.
    The certificates are being extended because of a shortage
of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for
exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz
said.
    Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine
months from the last day of the month of issuance.
    Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all
new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland
cotton program will have an expiration date of either February
29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in
which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.

to C from CCC-minus Michigan General Corp's 110 mln dlrs of
10-3/4 pct senior subordinated debentures due 1998.
    S and P said if Michigan General's exchange offer for the
debentures is not successful, the firm anticipates it will
default on the June 1 interest payment and will have to seek
protection from creditors under the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
    The exchange offer faces numerous obstacles, including the
tender of at least 90 pct of the debentures and additional
financing from lenders, S and P noted.
    The company's implied senior debt rating is CCC-minus.

<TITLE>TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House Ways and Means Committee
is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
approved.
     In investigations involving a processed agricultural
product, trade associations of processors or producers would
have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
duties.
     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
non-tariff barriers.
     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
through January 3, 1991.
    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
before Octoer 1, 1991.
    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
processed within three years after import and exported within
five years.
    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
imports.

    "We are in ongoing negotiations for the sale of our
Paraguay operations," the spokesman said. He declined to name

    A sale of the Paraguayan operations, which employ about 80
people, would be consistent with Bank of America's strategy of

recently, including Italy and Sri Lanka.

<TITLE>GENERAL HOST &lt;GH> TO APPEAL COURT RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STAMFORD, Conn., March 13 - </DATELINE><BODY>General Host Corp said a
federal district judge in Wichita, Kan., affirmed a preliminary
1984 ruling that the company's Amerian Salt Co unit polluted
groundwater near a plant in Lyons, Kan.
    The company said it would appeal the ruling, which calls
for actual damages of 3.1 mln dlrs and punitive damages of 10
mln dlrs.
    General Host believes it has strong grounds for a reversal
of the ruling. It reiterated that it is not including a
provision for losses in its financial statements.
    American Salt, part of General Host's AMS Industries Inc
unit, has agreed with the State of Kansas to carry out an
effective clean-up plan, the company said.
    In the current ruling, Federal Judge Cecil Miller affirmed
his August 1984 preliminary ruling.
    The suit was brought in 1977 by a group of local
landowners, a General Host spokesman said.
