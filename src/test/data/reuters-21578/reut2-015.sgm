<TITLE>DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Roughly half of this year's expected
130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
Netherlands, told Reuters.
    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
added.
    "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
crop is off to a very good start," he said.
    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A"
and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.
    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

<TITLE>U.K. EXPECTS SUBSTANTIAL DEMAND FOR ROLLS SHARES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Demand for shares in state-owned engine
maker &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> is expected to be substantial when the
government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark
of the group's bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said.
    He told a press conference after the release of an initial
prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to
U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.
    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be
made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.
    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond
saying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.
    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would
be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April
28.
    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment
in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous
privatisations.
    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls
was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted
that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had
several operations -- such as spare parts and military
equipment -- that evened out the swings.
    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986
was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary
according to changes in turnover.
    He noted that net research and development expenditure was
written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received
"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant
forecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.
    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to
120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.

<TITLE>VOLKSWAGEN DIVIDEND DECISION DUE TOMORROW</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.
    Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
around three billion marks at end-1985.

<TITLE>ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Zambian government has no immediate
plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
official of the ruling party said.
    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
which at least 15 people died.
    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
a practice discouraged by the IMF.
    "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of
Agriculture economist said.

<TITLE>MEDICAL JOURNAL REPORTS NEW INTERLEUKIN PROMISE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Promising new findings in the use of
a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a
cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a
Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the
magazine.
    Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp
&lt;CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp
&lt;IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.
    The journal, to be released late today, contains two
articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.
    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding
that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search
for a successful immunotherapy for cancer.
    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally
produced by living cells in the laboratory.
    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as
a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its
effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year
later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its
ravaging side effects.
    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of
Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly
significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after
it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer
patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers
and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart
Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.
    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no
remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side
effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital
care, according to the article.
    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers
administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct
remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in
melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.
    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four
patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness
of the drug's side effects as originally administered.
    "Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search
for successful immunotherapy for cancer," said the editorial,
signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.
    "These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely
did not describe successful practical approaches ready for
widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients," the

<TITLE>REPORT SEEKS TO DISALLOW SOUTHERN &lt;SO> COSTS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ATALANTA, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>An audit submitted to the Georgia
Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and
1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power
station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.
    Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct
interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would
cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant's
owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost
passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.
    The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report
by O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said the
report was released yesterday by the state attorney general.
    Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman
Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn
by the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same
bias against nuclear power that these auditors have
demonstrated in similar cases accross the country."
    Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without
fault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wish
we had done differently."
    Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submitted
to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power
would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.
    Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in
commercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latest
report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no
credit for the completion and "actually penalized us by
suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."
    Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could
have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts,
seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.
    He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for
another year "and it would have cost several hunderd million
dlrs more."
    Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by
schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we have
the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new
government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident
significantly increased construction time.

<TITLE>FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Argentine grain producers adjusted
their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
    Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
crops, including soybean.
    However, as the lands began drying later in the week
harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
4.1 mln.
    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
previously.
    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
tonnes.
    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
Buenos Aires in mid-April.
    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
mln tonne crop.
    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
7.1 mln.
    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
sown in 1985/86.
    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
this were not available.
    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
not been as intense as in previous years.

<TITLE>DUTCH ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RISES IN MARCH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    THE HAGUE, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dutch seasonally adjusted unemployment
rose in the month to end-March to a total 693,000 from 690,600
at end-February, but was well down from 730,100 at end-March
1986, Social Affairs Ministry figures show.
    The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to
436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for
women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier
and 259,400 at end-March 1986.
    On an unadjusted basis total unemployment fell by 16,500 in
the month to end-March to 692,200. In March 1986 the figure was
725,000.
    A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a
smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year,
because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the
building industry. He said this explained the increase in the
adjusted statistics.
    Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at
end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.

affirmed the long-term debt ratings but cut the commercial
paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1 of Avco Financial Services Inc, a
unit of Avco Corp.
    Avco Financial has 2.5 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    For the paper cut, Moody's cited a higher risk profile
inherent in the company's core business. Moody's said the
affirmation reflected its assessment of a less diversified risk
profile in the company's receivables.
    Affirmed were Avco Financial's A-3 senior debt, Baa-2
senior subordinated debt and Baa-3 junior subordinated debt.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Top officials of leading industrial
nations arrived at the U.S. Treasury main building to begin a
meeting of the Group of Five.
    Officials seen arriving by Reuter correspondents included
West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl, French Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur and his central banker Jacques de Larosiere.
    Also seen arriving were Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa and Japan's central bank governor Satoshi Sumita and
British Chancellor of the Exchequer and central bank governor
Robin Leigh Pemberton.
    There was no immediate sign of Italian or Canadian
officials. Monetary sources have said a fully blown meeting of
the Group of Seven is expected to begin around 3 p.m. local
time (1900 gmt) and last at least until 6 p.m. (2200 gmt), when
a communique is expected to be issued.
    Italian sources said Italian acting Finance Minister
Giovanni Goria met Treasury Secretary James Baker last night.
    At those talks Baker apparently convinced Goria, who
declined to attend the February meeting of the Group of Seven
in Paris, that Italy would participate fully in any meaningful
decisions.

temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase
agreements, economists said.
    Economists expect the Fed to execute 2.0-2.5 billion dlrs

two-week bank reserve maintenance period today. Some also look
for a permanent reserve injection to offset seasonal pressures
via an outright purchase of bills or coupons this afternoon.
     The Federal funds rate opened at 6-3/8 pct and remained at

<TITLE>FORD &lt;F> EXTENDS INCENTIVES ON LIGHT TRUCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    DEARBORN, Mich., April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Ford Motor Co said it extended
its buyer incentive program on light trucks to April 30 from
April 6, the program's previous expiration date.
    Ford, which saw a 23 pct rise in its March truck sales over
the March 1986 level, said the incentives were extended to
"maintain its truck sales momentum."
    The program itself was not changed. Customers have a choice
of 3.9 to 9.9 annual percentage rate financing or a cash rebate
of 300 dlrs or 600 dlrs, depending on the type of transmission
chosen.
    Ford last week extended to April 30 from March 12 its
incentive program on its compact trucks and the Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable cars.

<TITLE>FAO REPORTS BETTER CROPS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>World output of staple foods maintained
growth in 1986, following a record harvest the year before, and
most of the increase was in developing countries, the director
general of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
said.
    Speaking to FAO's committee on world food security, Edouard
Saouma said sub-Saharan Africa registered a cereal production
increase of 3.6 pct in 1986 and the Far East also continued to
increase production.
    Despite ample supplies worldwide, many countries face
problems in paying for all the food they need, he said.
    Saouma said many of the developing world's food problems
were the result of "chaotic" world trade.
    He said it was vital to promote employment to improve the
"food-security situation" of the poor, with policy reforms in
developing countries to remove existing disincentives to
production so that agriculture could play a greater role in
stimulating economic growth.

<TITLE>ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HOUSTON, April 8 - </DATELINE><BODY>Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
major company executives predicted.
    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
the old ones."
    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
by as much as 300 pct, he said.
    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
history.
    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire
chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
Oreffice said.
    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
U.S. chemical exports.
    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
in the early 1980s.
    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
    "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually
kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.
    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman
cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be
ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."
    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
along the Texas Gulf Coast.
    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
are the building blocks of specialty products.
    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand
is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.
