<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.,
chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat,
soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill
to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains
producers.
    Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter
wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility
of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support
payments regardless of how much acreage they planted.
    He also said his bill would protect program participants
from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose
above the loan rate.

<TITLE>BAKER SAYS U.S. OPPOSES SOVIET BANK MEMBERSHIP</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund.
    Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think
our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support
and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the
IMF."
    Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified and
unconditional."
    The secretary observed that he has written to congressman
Jack Kemp, a New York Republican who is also a presidential
contender, outlining the U.S. position.
    Baker was responding to a questioner who noted that World
Bank President Barber Conable has in the past suggested future
Soviet membership could take place.
    Ever since Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev suggested Soviet
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade --
which was also rejected -- there has been speculation Moscow
was interested in joining the international institutions.

<TITLE>SHEARSON LEHMAN UPGRADES U.S. OIL STOCKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Analyst Sanford Margoshes of Shearson
Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks
today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in
holding to its prescribed production quotas.
    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota
restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.
    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to
higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes
said he recommends Imperial Oil &lt;IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,
Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon &lt;XON> one to
83-1/8, and Chevron &lt;CHV> 1-1/8 to 54-7/8.
    In addition, Margoshes said he recommended Atlantic
Richfield &lt;ARC> on a short-term basis, though he said he is
still suspect about its debt situation. Atlantic Richfield rose
1-3/4 to 77.
    He said "the market could come down to test the 16 dlr a
barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is
positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher
oil prices."
    He noted that belief that the government is interested in
raising the strategic reserves is factored into the rise in oil
stocks today.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
invited the European Community's 17-man Commission for talks in
Bonn next month in a bid to repair strained relations, EC
diplomats said.
    The Commissioners, led by President Jacques Delors, will
pay a two-day visit to Bonn on April 1-2 when they were due for
a meeting with the principal West German cabinet members.
    The meeting, the first of its kind between the Commission
and the government of a member state, was originally meant to
focus on problems posed by West Germany's federal constitution.
    But they said the meeting was now likely to be dominated by
Commission plans to restructure the EC's exhausted finances and
its costly farm policy, which have provoked strong opposition
from Bonn.
    Kohl has written two letters to Delors, complaining that
the plans would hit West German farmers hard.  His farm
minister Ignaze Kiechle has publicly criticised the two German
members of the Commission for failing to oppose them.
    This caused protest from Brussels where the Commission
tries to guard the independence of its members from the
governments that nominate them.

<TITLE>ZAMBIAN MINISTER CONFIRMS COPPER DIVERSION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LUSAKA, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala
confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South
Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had
closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic.
    He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an
interview the government was diverting all mineral exports
along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in
Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper
and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports,
but he said there had not been any problem with the new
arrangements.
    "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations
without hindrance," he told the Times.
    The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia
exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and
17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic
sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's
ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam
without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports.
    Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in
Johannesburg, since it was now redundant.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes
to get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    In testimony before a House appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said that he had given that message to Brazilian
officials earlier this month when they met for talks in
Washington.
    He said that the so-called Cruzado Plan had worked for a
while, but that new efforts by the government are now required.
    Baker made it clear that he backed the decision by the
Paris Club official creditors to reschedule loans to Brazil,
even though the country later froze its payments to commercial
bank creditors.
    He said that the official loans are being serviced and that
this was a result of the rescheduling.

<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>K Mart Corp said recent talks to sell
65 remaining Kresge variety stores and their underlying real
estate to F.W. Woolworth Co &lt;Z> have ended.
    Robert Stevenson, K Mart vice president, told Reuters the
talks, which began about six weeks ago, ended. He declined to
give a reason.
    Kresge is the forerunner of what is now the K Mart chain.
The name was changed to K Mart in 1977, Stevenson said.
    "We're selling and buying real estate in our real estate
division, and Woolworth was interested in some of our
properties. The talks were of a casual nature," he said.
    The 65 Kresge stores that are scattered around the country
in downtown and suburban locations, he said.
    Stevenson said K Mart will continue to operate the stores.
"The stores are profitable. The only decision K Mart has made
is that we will continue to operate them," he said
    Kresge had been a nationwide chain of 900 variety stores.

<TITLE>U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct
at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by
the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged
when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,
Lawson said.
    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling
M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be
taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as
the exchange rate.
    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to
the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the
corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business
sector in particular.
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the
PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.

in 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German Feed
Stuff Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs
sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around
75 pct in 1986.
    He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk
quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to
cheaper imports from abroad.
    "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"
Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production to
decline steadily."
    The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by
0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes
from 3.23 mln, he said.
    Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairy
cattle will decline even more this year because of the further
cut in milk output from April.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The &lt;New York Stock Exchange> said it
is undertaking a review of the long-term effects on securities
markets of computer-driven trading techniques known as program
trading.
    The NYSE said, "The study will review major new trading
techniques involving programmed portfolio hedging and index
arbitrage for their potential benefits and risks to the
financial system.  It will also explore the regulatory
implications of these trading techniques and whether their
increased use could possibly lead to market abuse."
    The exchange said a final report is expected before the end
of 1987.  It said program trading is becoming increasingly
important as a market factor.

<TITLE>PHOENIX CANADA OIL TO APPEAL RULING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    Toronto, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Phoenix Canada Oil Co Ltd> said it
intends to appeal a ruling in U.S. Federal District Court of
Delaware on its suit against Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, Chevron Corp
&lt;CHV>, Chevron's Gulf Oil unit and their Ecuador subsidiaries.
    The court ruled against Phoenix's claim that a royalty it
held should have entitled it to a share of the 160 mln U.S.
dlrs paid to the defendants when they sold 62.5 pct of their
working interest in Ecuador oil operations, Phoenix said.
    However, the court did award Phoenix 1,250,000 Canadian
dlrs in underpayments, the company said.
    Phoenix Canada Oil said the fiduciary relationship that
existed between Phoenix, as the royalty owner, and the
defendants, as the working interest operators, was fundamental
in the oil industry and was not reflected in the court's
ruling.

<TITLE>CONSERVATIVE GAINS MAY SPEED FINNISH MARKET REFORM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Simon Haydon, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    HELSINKI, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Conservative gains in Finnish general
elections could speed liberalisation of financial markets,
though there will not be a radical economic restructuring,
conservative officials and economic analysts said.
    The conservatives gained nine new seats in parliament after
the two-day elections, which ended yesterday, and political
commentators say social democrat Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa is
likely to be replaced by a centre-right coalition.
    International spokesman Pasi Natri told Reuters: "we are
willing to liberalise the economy as much as possible."
    Helsinki analysts said the outgoing centre-left coalition
had introduced major reforms of money and stock markets in its
period of government between 1983 and 1987.
    They said Finnish conservatives bore little resemblance to
other European conservative movements and had, for example,
shelved privatisation policies to increase their popularity.
    Finnish trade affairs are dominated by its special ties
with its neighbour, The Soviet Union, and a new centre-right
coalition could alter this relationship, the analysts said.
   The two countries have a long-term pact under which trade
must be balanced in value. The 1987 accord signed in January
agreed bilateral trade totalling about 30 billion markka.
    Finland exports finished products to the USSR, with crude
oil accounting for 80 pct of imports.
    The Centre Party said before the elections that Fenno-
Soviet trade would have to be cut because Finland had to trim
exports when the value of Moscow's oil exports to Finland fell.
    Finnish financial markets reacted cautiously to the
election news, with little movement in the markka or on the
Helsinki stock exchange.
    Securities analysts said the market would respond positively
if a centre-right coalition was formed, but added it was too
early to exclude the possibility that social democrats would
hang on to power.
    The spokesman said conservatives favoured legislation
governing the stock market to prevent "casino-style behaviour."
    He said the conservatives also favoured the establishment
of an internal market between the Nordic countries.
     International capital markets were becoming more and more
important, he  said, adding conservatives would speed up the
development of Finland's capial markets.
   He said the conservatives supported the bilateral trade ties
with Moscow, but that links with western Europe should be
studied. Finland is a member of the European Free Trade
Association ( EFTA).
    Negotiations between the major Finnish political parties
are likely to be protracted, and the shape of the new
government will probably not be established before the start of
April.
    Conservatives hold 44 seats now, The Centre Party gained
three to 40 and the social democrats lost one, and now hold 56
seats.

<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>BankAmerica Corp may place its
long-term loans to Brazil on nonaccrual status if Brazil
continues to defer interest payments on the loans, the bank
holding company said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Brazil currently
total about 2.7 billion dlrs, including about 1.5 billion dlrs
in long-term loans and 1.2 billion dlrs in short-term loans.
    The Brazilian government announced in February its
intention to stop paying interest temporarily on its long-term
public and private sector commercial bank debt.
    "Continued deferral of interest payment on these obligations
could result in the loans being placed on nonaccrual status,"
the banking firm said.
    BankAmerica said its outstanding loans to Mexico currently
total about 2.5 billion dlrs, of which about 215 mln dlrs of
loans have been reported as either nonaccrual or past due 90
days or more.
    Outstanding loans to Venezuela currently total about 1.3
billion dlrs, of which 241 mln dlrs of loans have been reported
as either nonaccrual or past due 90 days or more, it said.

<DATELINE>    LINZ, Austria, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>State-owned &lt;Chemie Linz AG> is
likely to record a 1986 loss of some 600 mln schillings
compared with a 340 mln loss in 1985, a company spokesman said.
    Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were
largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the
effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S.
Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters.
    The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not
been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary &lt;Merx
HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from
the oil market. The firm will announce 1986 results in July.

<DATELINE>    BONN, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>The proposed European Community (EC) tax
on vegetable oils and fats is no longer a major issue on the
agenda and the EC Commission merely used it as a threat, the
West German Feed Stuffs Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association chairman Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
the West German feed industry believes the EC does not
seriously contemplate the introduction of such a tax because it
would end in another transatlantic trade war.
    "We have just avoided a trade conflict with the U.S. And the
Commission used the tax threat to calm national farm lobbies."
    American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne
Bennett said yesterday in The Hague that U.S. Soybean producers
were confident the tax would be rejected.
    Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean delegations on
a lobbying tour of EC capitals, will also visit Bonn on
Thursday and Friday.
    There are indications the Bonn government will also reject
the proposed tax, Wagner said.

<TITLE>EXXON &lt;XON> MAY CLOSE ONE FRENCH REFINERY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, MARCH 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Exxon Corp, the world's largest oil
company, said in a published interview today that it was
reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to
close on of its french refineries.
    Lee R. Raymond, Exxon's new president, singled out the
possibility of a closure of one of Exxon's refineries in France
during the interview.
    An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had
specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no
specific refinery had been named. She also said that all of
Exxon's opertations were under constant review.
    Exxon currently has two refineries in France, FOS in the
mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and
Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity.
    Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an influential trade
journal, said, in its current issue, that they understood that
Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in
Antwerp, Southern France or possibly Italy.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said
that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the
improvement in the European refining situation, its future
profits there should be good.
    "Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of
refineries in Europe, upgraded the rest and shaken many of the
indepedents out of the market. Now with demand for products
rising and efficient operations, Exxon should show superior
earnings," Mlotok said.
    "Just after Royal Dutch &lt;RD>, they are seen as one of the
highest grade refiners in Europe," he added.
    Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to
feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe
where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as
these producers move further into downstream operations.
    PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect
increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export
refineries.
    PIW said "sales from Libya, Algeria and elsewhere are
expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European
refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last
year."

<TITLE>ITALY STANCE ON EC OILS TAX NOT ENCOURAGING-ASA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    ROME, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Italy's response to protests by U.S.
Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC)
tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging,
American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George
Fluegel said.
    Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer
delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told
Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the
Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded
much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the
proposed tax.
    Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative
response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the
attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared "more realistic."
    He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S.
Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the
EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds.
    Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against
the proposed tax, he said, "Realistically, from the information
we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans,
hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark." His delegation also
hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added.
    Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might
take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved,
Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could
be involved.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC
yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the
tax.
    ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The
Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed
tax would be rejected.

<DATELINE>    TEL AVIV, March 17 - </DATELINE><BODY>Israel has drawn up a five-year plan
for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs
to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli
Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be
increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average.
    The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level
of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in
80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985
level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in
force, the ministry said.
    Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000
tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82
pct. Maize production is targetted to rise by 48,000 tonnes, or
48 pct, and exports by 34,000 tonnes, or 45 pct.
